We come in peace. That's why we're here. Isn't that the whole idea of Starfleet?
You don't trust me, Captain?
Technically, we would be lost.
 I estimate one hour, 17 minutes, 22 seconds. Which is why I've made sure we're not lost. The map says the well is this way, Captain.
(They walk on.)
This drought's going to last 89 years. The Crepusculans are facing extinction as a species. See those egg sacs? Those are their offspring.
Right, and if we don't do something now, they won't live another thousand hours. The ambient radiation from a nearby drilling accident dried out their water table. If we can get in and out without making contact, we can steer clear of General Order One. And there is the well.
Ye of little faith.
Point 7 second field burst at level setting 13.5.
The storm is moving faster than I thought. The ship won't be able to pick up our signatures. Unless we can contact Lieutenant Saru, we could be trapped here until it's over.
Why? Captain, where are we going?
But now we're really lost. We're far too small to be seen with the naked eye. And you can't set a course without a star. Is it wise to be heading away from the village?
I'm grateful, Captain. Though I would be significantly more so if I thought we had any chance of ever returning to the ship
A likely scenario unless we die here in the desert.
As a xenoanthropologist, I could reveal myself to the natives, learn their culture, try to fit in, if possible. And you, Captain? What will you do if we're trapped here for 89 years?
These are our footprints. You've walked us in a circle.
How did they find us?
First Officer's Log, Stardate 1207.3. On Earth, it's May 11th, 2256. A Sunday. The crew of the USS Shenzhou has been called to the edge of Federation space to investigate damage done to one of our interstellar relays. Blast burns around the hole are inconclusive. Were they caused by an asteroid, or was it deliberately destroyed to limit Starfleet communications? And if so, by whom? Despite the risks of our mission, I remain optimistic. It's hard not to be in the face of such beauty. In this case, a binary star system. Around these two suns, ice, dust and gasses collide to form the planets future generations will call home. A humbling reminder that all life is born from chaos and destruction.
Well, keep looking.
Finish your scans so you can express facts instead. The bridge is yours, Mister Saru.
Your Chief Science Officer is worried. Something took a bite out of our relay. Saru thinks it was malicious.
By all indications, nothing intelligent.
Starfleet's reputation for tech hygiene is exemplary. When a relay goes down, the Federation sends a ship to fix it.
If they are, they have.
Is this amount of sarcasm always necessary?
Range is 2,000 kilometres. Bearing 358 mark 269. Roughly 150 metres long, tucked into that accretion disk almost directly below us. It's in a sensor dead zone. Some kind of scattering field is confounding the ship's ability to translate the image.
With such little data, I'd prefer not to speculate.
Here we are, speculating.
I'll go. All I need is a thruster pack.
Like noodles? I'll be back in 19. A flyby.
You do understand that being afraid of everything means you learn nothing. There's no opportunity to discover, to explore.
Best to keep variables to a minimum. I wouldn't want to put my colleague at risk.
We've come all this way, Captain. It would be irresponsible to leave whatever that is unknown.
Just a flyby.
This is Commander Burnham. Commencing reconnaissance mission to field void and unknown object. Data collection is on and nominal. All lights are green.
Computer, enable igniter.
Aye, Captain.
I'm fully aware.
Shenzhou, do you copy?
Shenzhou, do you copy?
Hello. Shenzhou, are you able to see this?
Shenzhou, do you copy? Data Collection Unit, are you there?
Good. Mission time?
Plenty of time to take a peek. Even from this distance, it's clearly not debris.
I can't remember who said sculptures are crystallized spirituality. Headlamp. But I see what they meant. This is Burnham in the blind. I'm above the object, which is old. Centuries old. It's difficult to tell if it was constructed or carved. The only word to effectively describe it is wow. But I'll try to be more precise. Its surface has the appearance of stone with an exoskeleton of metal alloy. Oh, incredibly intricate. The construction and design are nothing short of astounding. I wish you could see what I'm seeing. It is sublime. It's impossible to discern a practical purpose. I'm going to land on it, get a closer look. Nice and easy. Hold on. My presence has triggered some sort of motion response.
I'm Commander Burnham of the United Federation of Planets.
Inviolable honour-shame dynamic.
Unwelcoming to the Federation.
Twenty four great Houses.
No.
Please. Stop!
Sarek. I'm sorry. I can do better.
I was dreaming.
Klingons. How did I get here?
Three hours?
There's no time.
What's going on?
What Have they made contact?
There are Klingons out there. We need to go to red alert.
I have. One attacked me on that object. Check my helmet cam.
He was warrior caste. His... his EV suit bore a Klingon house insignia.
I am not delusional. This has nothing to do with a concussion. Philippa, there are Klingons.
He ambushed me. I hit my thruster pack to get away. I somehow knocked him into his blade. I killed him. But that object could be hiding a Klingon raiding party, obscured behind their scattering field.
Target phase cannons on the object.
I didn't say anything about destroying it. Let's make them think we're going to attack.
Wait. Any response?
Not the most efficient defense.
Their entire ship is covered with coffins.
I'm afraid that's no longer possible.
Admiral, if I may. The ideal outcome for any Klingon interaction is battle. They're relentlessly hostile, sir. It's in their nature.
With respect, it would be unwise to confuse race and culture.
Saru is the only one talking. He strongly believes we should about-face.
Not if. When.
That's the diplomat in you talking. What does the soldier say?
It seems to be some sort of signal emitter.
 It's a signal pulse.
This may be the message. Captain, what if they're calling for the same thing we are? Backup.
Permission to leave the bridge, Captain?
It's relevant.
Computer.
Open dedicated subspace channel 222AA7.
Voiceprint authorise. Burnham, Michael.
Hello, Sarek. I'm happy to see you. They inform my logic. I need your help.
We've encountered the Klingons. I killed one. We're facing off. No fire has been exchanged. But they didn't turn on their beacon until Starfleet was on its way to our position. I think they're summoning more of their kind.
A war. This isn't about what happened, Sarek. It's what's happening now. How did the Vulcans achieve diplomatic relations with the Klingons? Sarek, please. Tell me. How did you keep the Klingons at bay?
Captain, we have to fire on them. Hit that ship with everything we've got.
The Klingon threat is always imminent and inevitable.
240 years ago, near H'Atoria, a Vulcan ship crossed into Klingon space. The Klingons attacked immediately. They destroyed the vessel. Vulcans don't make the same mistake twice. From then on, until formal relations were established, whenever the Vulcans crossed paths with Klingons, the Vulcans fired first. They said hello in a language the Klingons understood. Violence brought respect. Respect brought peace. Captain, we have to give the Klingons a Vulcan hello.
It would be logical for you to take into account my success rate during our seven years together, and execute my plan without further challenge before we're dragged into war.
We have to. Captain. I apologise for my insubordination.  Don't underestimate them. I've overseen their exercises. They're ready for battle.
My commitment to this course of action is not emotional. We target its neck, cut off its head.
Thousands of lives will be lost because of failure to act. 
And your life, Captain. Yours. You're right. I may not be myself. I'm sorry.
You're relieved, Mister Saru. I provided her with Klingon intel from a personal source on Vulcan. She's passing it to the Admiral. Weapons, slot a pair of photon torpedoes in the tubes and compute a firing solution targeting the neck of that Klingon ship. We have to be ready in case that's what the Captain decides. 
 I'm your superior officer. We are in a high-risk scenario. Question chain of command again and I'll remove you. Target phasers. Take your station, Commander. Move, Saru. Tactical.  Fire!
Captain, please. I'm trying to save you. I'm trying to save all of you.
No. Those ships are Klingon.



Respect is earned, as is friendliness.This is hardly a negotiation.  Less. On Vulcan, lateral vector transporter technology has been discarded due to the massive amount of power it requires.
I have no standards when it comes to this ship. It was always my intention to join the Vulcan Expeditionary Group. Emotional platitudes are not what I was hoping for. As I have seen yours.
As is yours. It appears to be functional. Thank you Captain. The Klingon High Council consists of 24 houses. That can't be a coincidence. The number of ships. It suggests that someone is attempting to unify the Empire again, against us. Computer, how badly have we been hit? Who's there? Connor, what happened? Who else was hurt? Is... is the Captain all right? I can't help. I'm locked up for mutiny.
Connor, you took a blow to the head. Activate that comm panel and call Doctor Nambue.
Sarek? How is it possible? A mind-meld across a thousand light years?  I couldn't convince Captain Georgiou to strike the Klingons first, so I took matters into my own hands. You're disappointed. As you should be. What's wrong? Then leave me. Please. You were never one to bolster my self-esteem. 
Computer, implement steps of brig emergency evacuation protocol. This is a life-saving circumstance. I'm going to die in here unless you let me out. How long before my cell's containment field fails?
Is the corridor outside the brig undamaged and still pressurised? But if you open a metre-sized hole in the containment field, the rapid depressurization will shoot me through to the blast door in less than six seconds. Then ethically you should open the door for me.  I'll take it. 
Captain, you can't do that. T'Kuvma has anointed himself the next Klingon messiah. If you kill him, you make him a martyr. Someone they can fight for endlessly. That might even be what he wants. But if you capture him, you make him a symbol of defeat, of shame. And if you take him as a prisoner of war, well, you give the Federation leverage to sue for peace. I believed it was the only way to avoid a full-scale war. You want to know how I turned on you? I believed saving you and the crew was more important than Starfleet's principles. Was it logical? Emotional? I don't know. Let me deliver the warheads in your place. They're gathering their dead. This is the aft section of the bridge. T'Kuvma must be close.
Get us out of here now.  I'm not leaving without her body. More Klingons are coming. No! Guilty.
 Guilty on all counts. From my youth on Vulcan, I was raised to believe that service was my purpose, and I carried that conviction to Starfleet. I dreamed of a day when I would command my own vessel and further the noble objectives of this great institution. That dream is over. The only ship I know in ruins, my crew gone. My captain, my friends, I wanted to protect them from war, from the enemy. And now we are at war, and I am the enemy.




Eight thousand, one hundred and eighty six. That's species GS54. An organism that feeds on electricity. It's feeding on the shuttle's power systems.  Unless the pilot can get rid of the infestation fast enough, they'll drain us of all of our power, and we'll drift until our oxygen runs out or we freeze to death. Whichever comes first.  Keyla. Suus Mahna. Captain, what am I doing on this ship?  I received no warning that I'd be transferred to another prison facility, which is customary. Then my shuttle changed course halfway through the journey. Sir? Question is, what am I gonna do with you? If I put you in the brig someone's gonna die, and I don't have the time for that kind of distraction. You have training in high-level quantum physics, don't you? My engineers tell me it's gonna take three days to clear the lightning bugs out of the prisoner shuttle. I have something on deck that requires every trained mind available. You're gonna help us out. No. No, thank you. Respectfully, I owe a debt for my crime and it'd be best... I'd prefer to serve my time without getting involved. And what mission is that, sir? Working on what? Why are you nervous? Seriously? No problem. Michael. No, you won't. What's going on? No. 
Tilly, what the hell is going on on this ship?  Saru. Congratulations on your promotion.  I understand. 
The ones in prison don't taste the same. I suppose that is a function of the environment your eating them in instead of a food synthesiser issue. I suppose so. So many people with so many places to go. 
So, this is a science vessel. Saru. First Officer Saru. I saw a recording of the speech you gave at the Captain's funeral. It was beautiful. I never thought I'd get a chance to say this to you. I think about what happened every day. All the time. And I owe you. I'm trying to say... Yes. I just wanna get back on that shuttle, Commander. I won't make any trouble for you here. I'm looking for Lieutenant Stamets. 
Starfleet doesn't keep its engineering labs classified. I'm Michael Burnham. I was assigned. Yes. Yes.
There may be a misunderstanding. Yes. No.  I was raised on Vulcan, and I attended the Vulcan Science Academy. I'm not sure I'm following.  I'm struggling with these equations. Initially thought I was dealing with quantum astrophysics. But as I got deeper in, biochemistry came into play. Maybe even a form of gene expression. It'd be helpful to know what I'm working on. It's your call. But either way, this line here? It's a mistake. Not really.  I understand. It's okay. You're a nice kid, Tilly, but I'm not staying long enough to make friends.  Basidiosac? That's an unfamiliar term. Basidia refers to spore-producing structures. The numbers I've been analysing have been consistent with organic structures. You mentioned the term bloom. That typically refers to biologicals.  I'm trying to get up to speed, so that I can help with this mission. In what is our problem based, biology or physics? Sir?  All right. Lieutenant Stamets, I sincerely have no idea what research you're involved in. I never even intended to be here. What the hell could do this to a dozen fully armed Klingons?  Run. In here. What was that thing? Log data's corrupted. Jammed. One Federation ship is pretty much like another, I hope. I need a phaser. I'm not trying to kill it, I'm trying to piss it off. Hey. Shit, that worked. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself, but instead found herself falling down a very deep well. 
Jefferies tube. Elevate the shuttle 200 feet, rear quarter, above the shield replacement units. Open the top hatch. (turns into a smaller tube) She was now only ten inches high. Her face and body brightened up. She was now the right size to go through the little door into that lovely garden.  Go! 
Permission to enter the bridge, Commander Saru. The Captain requested my presence. I'll be on it, sir.
 I appreciate your faith in me. Thank you. Captain. Sir, I've been court-martialed and convicted. I'm afraid I can't take you up on your offer.  That's not it. Not all of it, anyway. Let me answer your question with a question. Why do you want me to stay? I'm not here by accident. I think you brought me here. I think you've been testing me. You're developing some kind of experimental technology. Some kind of spore-based biological weapon.  The kind of weapon that is explicitly forbidden by the Geneva Protocols of 1928 and 2155. And you need someone to help you. Enter, me. A mutineer who intended to wage unsanctioned war on the Klingons. A trained officer who's been banished from Starfleet. And someone who would presumably do anything to get out of their life sentence in prison, including illicit weapons tests, like whatever went wrong on the Glenn. I'm not who you think I am. Before I was a mutineer, I was a First Officer in Starfleet. I'll never bear that rank or any other again. But it is who I am, and who I will always be. It is by the principles of the United Federation of Planets that I live. And by them I will most certainly die. Black alert. How do you travel on spores? The veins and muscles that hold our galaxies together.  I'm still here. Hope you don't mind. Captain. Captain Georgiou. It's okay. 
When I was a kid, after my parents were killed, my foster mother on Vulcan used to read it to me and her son. She and I were the only humans in the house. That's how I learned that the real world doesn't always adhere to logic. Sometimes down is up. Sometimes up is down. Sometimes, when you're lost, you're found. Amanda. 





Computer, cancel mirror.  It's not quite as easy as that. Tilly. I'll see you in Engineering. Bridge. Direct. Captain Lorca offered me an opportunity. I can tell by your threat ganglia that you weren't consulted. A valuable asset. That's what you called me. You can tell your threat ganglia to relax. I'm only here to help.  They need us to win. I'm happy to assist Lieutenant Stamets with the refinement of the spore drive.  I also studied quantum mechanics at the Vulcan Science Academy, sir. These are some of the deadliest weapons in the galaxy. Why would you keep something so dangerous onboard your own ship?  How do you know it's a monster, Commander? Your Ripper appears to share some natural traits with the Tardigrade species, a docile creature that lives in the waters of the Earth. A micro-animal capable of surviving e xtreme heat and subfreezing temperatures. In our case, somehow, macroscopic. All the recent logs were corrupted, but the Glenn's captain made an earlier entry that security detected a stowaway. There was no hull breach, and no unregistered microbiota in the transporter's pattern buffer, but this was found rummaging around in the lower cargo decks. You judge the creature by its appearance, and by one single incident from its past. Nothing in its biology suggests it would attack, except in self-defence. Commander, this creature is an unknown alien. It can only be what it is and not what you want it to be. Look. The moment the spore drive came online, the creature's central nervous system showed micro-patterns of activity in the frontopolar cortex. It reacted before we jumped. I saw it cry out in distress. It's more likely a connection to the spore drive itself.
It may not be, but it helps us understand its motives and behaviour. Wait, wait. Why are you sedating it? I do not think that's a good idea. We have no idea what effect sedation may have on it. And we've seen how it responds to aggression.  Computer, lights to maximum. Computer, seal containment pen. Emergency transport. Sickbay. Door. I've been thinking about the way I treated you on the Shenzhou. At times I was very unfair. You wouldn't be wrong to call me out for being selfish. But I can't help notice that your threat ganglia are quiet now. Fascinating. Commander Landry was about to attack the creature, and I believe her death was an act of self-defence on its part. And now, based on your lack of threat response, I'm ready to submit that the creature's primary drive is not aggressive. It's not a predator. They were necessary. Why were you on the Glenn? What were you looking for? Spores are the thing the Discovery and Glenn had in common. 
You should probably go. I appreciate you taking the risk, but this could be dangerous. Stay back. Keep still. (to the Tardigrade) I brought you something I think you might like. If you don't, well, they can blame whatever happens on my curiosity. Computer, open containment pen. Hello. These are Tilly's tricorder images from our mission on the Glenn. Look. The doors to the Engineering room were blown outward. The shatter pattern of the reaction cube, the destruction, like something inside was going crazy. A very big something. Then there's excess shielding surrounding the room. It's as if the crew was trying to keep something in. Captain's log said they found the creature in their lower decks. I remember you chided Straal about not growing his own like you do. You were talking about mushrooms. They didn't have a forest on the Glenn like Discovery has. If they stored their mushrooms dry, it would have to be in tremendous quantities in their lower stores, right there, where the creature first appeared. Their spores, actually. This ship's spore drive travels on a network of mycelium that's spread across the entire galaxy. We just can't control where we go. But maybe the Tardigrade can. Straal said he found a way to solve the navigation problem. You said his modifications needed a supercomputer, right? What if its name is Ripper? The phaser will only piss him off. My tricorder is detecting energy transfer. Some form of symbiosis. It is talking to them. Not just converse. Maybe even tell them where to go. If we can figure out how to interact with that tech from the Glenn, we may be looking at our new navigator.  Computer, open containment pen. Hey, you feeling better? I brought you the good stuff. I'm sorry. I accept.





Doctor Culber, I've been studying the creature since it came on board. It's incredibly regenerative, but with each jump Discovery makes, it cries out. And the last 48 hours, it seems sluggish, depressed. You think I'm anthropomorphising. Thank you.  Thank you, Tilly. There's nothing to tell. Tilly, it's not you. It's me. I'm out of sorts, and preoccupied. The Tardigrade. Each time we use the spore drive, it gets weaker. I barely have a job here. I've never been less busy.  I don't like it. I came to speak to Captain Lorca. Multiple jumps? I just don't know how feasible it's going to be. I'm concerned that we are negatively impacting the Tardigrade with each jump we make.  I disagree with that assessment. Not as of yet. No, of course not. I'm just worried. I don't know how much more the Tardigrade can sustain. The more you hurt someone, the less helpful they become. Yes, sir. I can handle him. Lieutenant Stamets. Your spore drive is genius. Beyond genius. What you've achieved for the war effort, for the whole of science itself, it's a contribution. We need to find a work-around. Making Ripper the critical component for the s-drive is unsustainable for the creature and your invention.  I didn't, either. I am swallowing the urge to set the record straight. Enter the Tardigrade, whose unique genetic makeup allows it to navigate through the network, because of its symbiotic relationship with the mycelium's spores. Like its microscopic cousins on Earth, the Tardigrade is able to incorporate foreign DNA into its own genome via horizontal gene transfer. When Ripper borrows DNA from the mycelium, he's granted an all-access travel pass. And you were only able to achieve small jumps. Let's do it. 
So far, we found one viable workaround. This hypospray contains Tardigrade DNA and replication catalysts that will initiate rapid horizontal gene transfer in a host. The interface process requires an evolved organism, a species with a highly functioning nervous system. And one that, like the Tardigrade, shares genetic information with mushrooms. The animal kingdom may have diverted from its fungal counterparts 600 million years ago, but Homo Sapiens still share over half of our DNA with them.  I know. And that's why we need more time.  Captain Saru, I understand that you are upset. You're in command. It's a time of crisis. And your culture trains you to be on the heightened lookout for enemies. But I assure you, I'm not one of them. Come. Cadet Tilly brought me up to speed. Sir, permission to speak freely. Are you really afraid of me? To be Captain Georgiou's First Officer. You did well. Very well. She would've thought so, too. She left it to me. It's yours now. You should have the privilege to see the universe the way she did. Of course. No. But if this is its response to an adverse environment, what does it consider to be hospitable? This creature has traveled to the ends of the universe. My hope is that what makes it most happy is to be free.



Two more laps before breakfast. You still need to shave six point five seconds off of your time.
Six point five. And yes, they matter, if you're ever gonna make Captain. Everyone applying to the Command Training Programme will be smart. Personality doesn't count. Six point five seconds is not an arbitrary number. Your new time will earn you a physical endurance commendation. Today, your goal is six point five seconds. Then, getting a transfer on a Constitution-class, like the Enterprise. After that, First Officer track. See your path, stay on it, reach your destination. Cadet to Captain, just like that. What's it going to be, Tilly? Computer, cancel that order. That's hardly the correct ratio of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Computer, three egg white breakfast burrito with black beans. Make it two. Computer, add roasted tomato salsa. Cooked tomatoes are a great source of lycopene. Remember that. Six? I've fought Klingons. I doubt it. I can't imagine Captain Lorca feeling that way about anyone. The same. You probably can believe everything you hear. I should go. Yes. No. Sarek. You brought me here. Sarek!  Sarek. It's not me, it's Sarek. He's in trouble. I share part of his katra, his eternal life force. I was raised as one. After my parents were killed at a Vulcan outpost. He believed I could serve as humanity's potential. But not everyone agreed with him. A group of logic extremists, they didn't want humans in their culture. They tried to stop him by killing me. They bombed the Learning Centre where I was educated. Renegade Vulcans, a small faction. And they didn't try, Doctor, they succeeded. I was dead for three minutes. The katra has a healing power and Sarek used it to save me. A kind of soul graft. It's a procedure that's frowned upon, and rare. Once. The start of the war. He sensed my distress and came to me. But this is different. I can feel him slipping away. I don't think this is a conscious effort on his part. Sarek is delirious. He might be dying. Captain, please. Captain, help me find him.  I still sense Sarek, but it's growing erratic. I think he's getting worse. Me. I'm guessing from your reaction that modifying this neural enhancer is a viable method to achieve what I need. I can sense that Sarek is unconscious. I want to use this mind-meld to wake him up so he can activate his ship's transponder.  I was thinking adrenaline shot, but okay.
Okay, so we go in with a shuttle. As long as I don't overstay my welcome, the shuttle shields can handle it, but I need someone to work the neural enhancer. I'd like Cadet Tilly. She's smart, and I could use the moral support. You know where Sarek's mind is? Where his dying thoughts have taken him? To me. No. No, you don't understand. I was supposed to be his proof that humans and Vulcans could coexist as equals, but I ended up being his greatest disappointment. That's what he's reflecting on. I was rejected from the Expeditionary Group for being too human. My failure is his last thought. He doesn't believe in me, but I'm supposed to save him. They will. Sarek is delirious. I can't allow him to push me like that out again. But fighting him is gonna put a massive strain on me. Don't. No matter what the sensors say, you leave me in there. Okay? Go. I'm sorry, Sarek. You were wrong to believe in me. Why are you doing this? You called me here. Your katra pulled me. You're near death. I can help you like you helped me. Give me a chance. Please.
 No, you're not.  I said I'm not leaving here without Sarek. Sarek keeps blocking me. I can't fight you, too. I don't know. His thoughts are fixed on my graduation day, but the emotions from that memory are too difficult for me to handle.  I'm going back in. Sarek. What are you hiding? (the fight restarts) What don't you want me to see? Is it really worth dying over? I can save you, Sarek, but you have to let me into your mind. Let me in. You had faith in me once. I'm asking you to have faith in me again. You chose Spock over me, didn't you? You were forced into that decision. Why not tell me the truth?  Instead, you made me believe I failed you. You manipulated me. Do you have any idea what living with that lie did to me? Shame? Show me how to save you like you saved me.  My thoughts to your thoughts. Wake up, Sarek. Tell us where you are. He'll live, but Doctor Culber says he can't meet the Klingons in this condition. The window for the talks closes in a few hours. Even if the Federation wanted to step in, they couldn't get there in time.
Much as it would displease my Vulcan mentor, I'm feeling a lot of emotions right now.  I'm not sure pride is one of them. But I do want to thank you, sir. You didn't have to mount this rescue mission for Sarek. I accept. I'm grateful to serve under a Captain like you.  it's good to see your strength returning. What do you recall of your rescue? Of what transpired between us? You know what happened. You could talk to me about it, help me understand what you did. It could make us grow closer, not further apart. That's what families do. You can do better. But I won't push you. We'll have this conversation one day, Father. I gave you bad advice. There are a million ways to get to the Captain's chair. Find your own. Stubborn and impenetrable as always. He claims he doesn't remember any of the mind-meld. I always knew I could never be who he wanted me to be. But I realised today that it goes both ways. I'll never get from him what I want, either. It's okay. Part of me feels unburdened. Thank you. All my life the conflict inside me has been between logic and emotion. But now it's my emotions that are fighting. I think about him and I want to cry, but I have to smile. And I feel angry but I want to love, and I'm hurt, but there's hope. What is this? Michael Burnham. Pleased to meet you. Have we? Let's try it again. 







Personal Log, Specialist Michael Burnham. Stardate 2136.8. Despite my fears to the contrary, I seem to have found my place on this Discovery. An air of routine has descended upon the ship, and even I am a part of it. I've made friends. Well, one, at least. I take comfort in my work. This ship has quickly become the most important weapon in the Federation's arsenal in our war against the Klingons. And because of her, the tide has turned. Because of us, we are winning. Lieutenant Stamets' ability to pilot the ship's spore drive has given him access not just to all of space, but to unseen parts of his personality as well. As we perform our daily responsibilities, I confess I find some members of my fellow crew more interesting than others. Lieutenant Tyler has suffered so much, and still maintains such dignity and kindness. I find him... intriguing. But I fear my personal history interferes with my ability to forge relationships. I am among the others... but also apart. I wish sorely to step out of my comfort zone, yet don't know how. But tonight, I will face one of my greatest challenges so far. Tonight we are having... a party. Starships have power-redundant relays. There shouldn't be any flickering.  Oh. I helped him calibrate pulse scope rifles in the armoury. And we ate lunch together because it was the end of our shift. Duly noted, when I'm actually on a date, which these were not. How does he compare to yours? Inappropriately so. Wait. No, I... To be clear. I wasn't attempting to be rude. It's just that my experience with parties is limited. Due to my rank, interpersonal fraternisation was... not appropriate. Oh! I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I'm sorry, Doctor Culber. I believe you've met Lieutenant Tyler. He's our new Chief of Security here. There is no deal. Scanners identify the object as biological. Xenobiological classification gormagander. Its health appears to be compromised. Hunting isn't the cause of its reduced numbers. It's primarily due to their mating practices, or lack thereof. They spend their lives feeding on alpha particles in solar winds. They're often so consumed by this task that they ignore all other instincts, including reproduction. Captain, the gormagander is on the endangered species list. Protocol requires us to transfer it to a xenologic facility.  No matter what she is, she is all alone. Energising. All right, sweet girl, let's see if we can't figure out what's got you down. Burnham to the Bridge. Intruder alert. Shots fired. Need immediate assistance. Inappropriately so. To be clear. I wasn't attempting to be rude. It's just that my experience with parties is limited. Yes, but due to my rank, interpersonal fraternisation was inappropriate. There aren't always simple answers to those kinds of questions. Stamets, slow down. It's a space whale.  I can't advise that, Captain. Captain, I'd like to run point on this, sir. As science specialist, I'm the most qualified to handle the needs of this creature. There have only been 57 cases of near-misses with starships in the last ten years. The odds are almost incalculable. Yeah. Activate transporter. Medical readings are abnormal, but nothing else is unusual. I'm gonna get closer readings. Faint. An energy pattern. Almost like a transporter beam. Tyler, you know this man. Computer, beam intruder to the brig. You are mad. Stamets, the drive. The gormagander is on the endangered species list. Okay. I think we need to get you to Sickbay. think these might be side effects of your... Exposure to the alien DNA. It's possible we haven't taken into consideration the cognitive variances. Well, how are you capable of existing outside of the time loop? Yes. So you remember everything? How is Mudd creating a time loop? Where is Mudd now? Starships have redundant power relays. There shouldn't be.  I wouldn't take you for this kind of event.  Why would you say that to me? I believe you. But what if he won't talk to me either? No. We don't have time for that. I mean. I am really bad at this.
And if what you say is true, then Tyler and I don't have any more alone time until the next reset. Our one chance to fix all this, and I blew it. I'm out of my element. But say I wanted to... step out of my... corner. How do people connect in that way?  That doesn't make any sense.  I can't say that I have. But after such a rude exchange, why would he do that?  I'm good at honesty. Hi. : I thought you'd never ask. Will you lead, please? So, I hear you were locked up in that Klingon prison cell with Harry Mudd. I've never understood it, really. But I've realised that relationships are built on honesty. So here it is. Harry Mudd is here. And in a few minutes, he's gonna take over this ship. He wants to sell it to the Klingons. He's already trapped us in a time loop.  I wish it were. He tried, in previous loops, but he felt like you'd have an easier time trusting me.  Because I like you. And he thinks you like me, too. That was nice. No, please ignore it. We have to. Did Mudd ever mention having access to equipment that could help him do something this big? Did he say how he did it? A time crystal. We learned about these at the Vulcan Academy. But the decay rate of the lattice is too unpredictable. No Federation-aligned species has ever been able to stabilise them. A four-dimensional race must have perfected the technology, and now Mudd has it. Let's go. Tilly, where are you? We all died. Many times. But now Mudd has everything that he needs, and if we can't find a way to stop him, then he'll let Discovery rejoin the time stream and sell the ship to the Klingons. Anyone who's dead'll stay dead forever. And Starfleet loses the war. I noticed that Mudd was wearing a crystal on his wrist, but it's too small to generate enough energy for chronal displacements. There has to be a larger energy source. Poor thing. No wonder you feel bad. Mudd hid the ship inside the creature and the crystal inside the ship. This crystal, it has the same orthogonal indices as the device on Mudd's wrist. No, because Mudd has control of all the critical systems, and we're running out of time. Now that Mudd knows how to work the spore drive, the only way is to get Mudd to reset time himself.No, he doesn't.You seem at home. You should have been a Captain.Hmm. And what about Stella? Are you done? The Klingons will pay a lot to win this war, but there is one thing they would pay more for.Me. I murdered T'Kuvma, the Klingon messiah.I'm not an officer. I'm Michael Burnham.You'll get a lot of money for this ship, but what would I be worth to them? Lieutenant Tyler.  Not for long.Lieutenant Stamets has shown us your success is a universal certainty. As am I. You win. You seem very happy. No, but Discovery's archives are non-critical systems. You probably should have disarmed them as well. And now that you don't have your time crystal, you can't learn from this mistake. No wonder you needed the deal with the Klingons so badly. You had to disappear. Another non-critical system. You didn't send our coordinates to your buyers. Turns out you can con a con man. Hey.Stamets told me in a previous timeline, that we er.Danced.  He said I liked it. I can't imagine. I didn't mean.What I'm feeling is complicated and strange.What is it? Personal log. Just as repetition reinforces repetition, change begets change. I guess the truth is, we never really know what's coming. Sometimes the only way to find out where you fit in is to step out of the routine, because sometimes where you really belong was waiting right around the corner all along.









Personal log, Specialist Michael Burnham. Stardate 1308.9. We landed on Pahvo eighteen hours ago. It's a seemingly uninhabited planet, but a unique and, for us, strategic one. Every tree, rock, and blade of grass here vibrates with its own specific tone. Together, these combine to form a kind of music - the signature sound of the planet, heard everywhere on the surface. The sound is even broadcast into space by a towering crystal structure, a sort of naturally occurring transmitter. It is Starfleet's plan to modify the electromagnetic frequency of Pahvo's signal and harness it as a form of sonar that can detect the presence of the cloaked Klingon vessels decimating our fleet, make them visible to our sensors, and turn the tide of war in our favour. You've been setting an accelerated pace since we got here. It's unfortunate that the transmitter's interference meant we had to beam down thirty kilometres away, but look around, it could be worse.  Kelpiens pursued by apex predators have exceeded speeds of eighty kilometres per hour. They can also sense predators from as much as ten kilometres.  I'm sorry. It's not registering as a lifeform, sir. According to this, it's actually not distinguishable from the rest of the forest. Universal translator's got nothing.  Are you all right? We can't touch that transmitter now. No. Order 1 restricts us from revealing ourselves to sentient beings that aren't warp-capable. We're well beyond that. Now our duty is to follow First Contact protocol, and we can't borrow or alter their property without them understanding our objective and agreeing to it.
He's got to. Convincing them to let us complete our mission is the only way.And the war ends. Easy.I haven't.Sounds perfect. Our futures look different. You go back to your lake house and I go back to prison. My sentence was life. This is just temporary. The needs of the many Or the one? How far did you get?  Is the transmitter their creation? You look exhausted. Oh, hello, Commander. Looks like someone got some sleep. Our new friend was okay with that?  So you're saying we have permission to complete our mission as planned? What are you doing? We can't do that, Commander.  Saru, something has happened to you. You are not thinking clearly.  Obviously Saru has been compromised.  I'm not sure we actually have the Pahvans' permission. You know the Federation has procedures. No starship may interfere with the normal development of any alien life or society.  But we can't trust anything he says. What about Saru?  Come on, come on, come on.  Yes. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Yeah. Michael Burnham to Discovery. Discovery, do you read me? Saru, please, stop. Saru, this isn't you. Is this what harmony and balance look like? Where is the peace you say you found here? I would give anything for a second, a millisecond, of peace. But until the war is over, none of us can have it. Saru, staying here, it's not gonna fix anything. We have the power to end this conflict. Saru, we need you. Please listen. Saru told you who we are, and like you, we seek harmony. But we face a threat that doesn't share that same goal. But with your help and our technology, we can put an end to this conflict. Isn't that why you exist? To keep harmony and peace? You have to help me finish what I've begun. Thank you. Saru, please look at me. Are you all right? You weren't yourself.  I thought it was, sir. The Pahvans repaired our signal inhibitor after Saru destroyed it. I watched it happen. Captain, I don't understand. The Pahvans .No. The Pahvans did that. Their entire existence is an effort to bring harmony to discord, and they know about our conflict. They're trying to bring us together. They think they're helping.We're the Pahvans' only line of defence. We have to protect them, sir. We have to fight. 






Currently We suspect the Klingon cloak generates a massive gravitational field, one that bends light and other electromagnetic waves around the ship. But the cloak has small imperfections, so what appears like background EM radiation actually contains near-imperceptible shifts that correlate to the cloak's gravitational field. Their shields and weapons are offline when they're invisible, so it gives us a small window to beam over after the cloak is down, but before their shields go up. There is a problem, though, sir. It will take time to gather sufficient data. Days. The effectiveness of our sensors depends on their placement at the points closest to the Klingon vessel's stern and bow. But their Bridge is roughly four times the size of any Federation ship. I've been there. Only one location will work. Lieutenant Tyler doesn't know how to access it. I do. Sir, you offered me a place on this ship . You are the Captain, but you are not using the full resources to ensure the success of your mission. There is no logic to your thinking. Unless this is about me. I'm here on borrowed time. When you asked me to stay, it was to help you win this war. Given the time I spent on that Klingon vessel, I'm the most qualified crew member to place those sensors. Otherwise, I have no purpose here.  Thank you, Captain. Pattern simulators are online. Our life signs are masked as Klingon. First drop point is six hundred metres this way. Out this door, down that passage.  I'm detecting a human life sign onboard. If we have a chance to rescue one of our people, we have to take it. The life sign isn't far from the Bridge. Just on the opposite side. It might even provide us a location to wait out the jumps. I have to bring everyone home.  Admiral. Admiral, I'm Specialist Burnham. Can you move? Tyler  Tyler! Here. I'm here. I'm here. Here, come on. He was a victim of Klingon torture. Captain Lorca dispatched us to install sensors aboard this ship so we could break the Klingon cloak. I have to make it to the Bridge.  I don't have a choice. Here. (gives her a phaser) Discovery'll beam us out when the time comes. Tyler, can you hear me? I'm gonna see this mission through. I meant what I said. Everybody comes home. General Kol, I wish to talk. This device is a universal translator. An example of human ingenuity. It's proof of our desire to communicate. You are Kol. You took T'Kuvma's place. I thought Klingons were honourable. Where is the honour of taking a ship that doesn't belong to you? You had no hand in the battle that caused this war. You were not here when T'Kuvma fell. Because I was here. I'm the one who killed T'Kuvma. Her name was Captain Philippa Georgiou. I regret that my actions that day have locked our people into this war. If you are to capture me, then prove your worth. T'Kuvma defeated the woman whom that belonged to. Do me the same honour. No, it's not. And neither is this. Doctor Culber.  It's gone, the Ship of the Dead. The planet of Pahvo is safe. We did that.  I need to know something. You put on a facade. Like everything that's happened to you just washes off. I actually envied that about you. But when you saw that Klingon... Who is she to you? You were her prisoner. What did you do? No. I'm glad you're here, too. You get to live your life the way you deserve to. Not at war but at peace.
