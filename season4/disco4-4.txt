The killer is a NiVar citizen

and a Qowat Milat nun known as JVini

Starfleet remands the prisoner

to your custody
for extradition to NiVar

BURNHAM First officer of the Credence

He had two kids

Then you know they deserved justice

I also know bringing NiVar
into the Federation

will benefit millions

There must have been
a sign it was coming

I missed it

What you require is freedom from guilt

My mind to your mind

It can be a little hard
to get out of your comfort zone

when you can barely get out of the lab

So getting the opportunity to do this

this could be really good for me

ADIRA Are you you

Im definitely me

CHUCKLES How do you feel

Whole

BURNHAM Captains log stardate  

Its been a week since my mission with the Qowat Milat

Since then weve stayed in orbit over NiVar

working with the NiVar Science Institute

and the Federation Task Force

thats tracking and studying the DMA

No other inhabited worlds have been threatened yet

but of course that can change at any moment

NiVar has fasttracked negotiations

to rejoin the Federation

I havent yet heard how theyre going

Were all living in uncertainty

Even for a crew as familiar with the unknown as this one

the stress is taking its toll

Im following Dr Culbers advice

mandating downtime to help

with their psychological and emotional wellbeing

But Stamets wont let himself slow down even for a second

He wants to solve this for all of us especially Book

Book

Even though the mind meld with TRina helped at the time

the peace he felt has been

fleeting

Ive encouraged him to talk to Dr Culber

but I feel him pulling into himself

A natural response to grief crisis

all of this

But he cant do this alone

None of us can

SARU Captain President Rillak has requested

our presence on NiVar

For the summit with President Trina

Negotiations are coming to a close

Uh but Admiral Vance has fallen ill

with what I am told is
a Malindian stomach worm

The accepted medical guidance is

to allow the worm to gestate
before extraction

 Mm How long will that take
 hours

We are to replace him
in his diplomatic capacity

I would love to be there

when NiVar officially
rejoins the Federation

but DMA analysis has to take priority

Im sure she doesnt need both of us

Well to clarify
President Rillak did not imply

a choice in the matter

Did she brief you on how exactly

were meant to participate

Oh we are to and I quote

Remain silent and look
official nothing more

I still feel lost

Your time with the Qowat Milat
wasnt helpful

No it was

They have this whole
absolute candor thing

So I kind of tried that on myself

And

Its

Its like you know all these years

I think I have been
on the straightline path

to the captains chair

and just trying to get there
as fast as I could

But now I think maybe

Maybe you need to take a detour

STAMMERS Yeah I have been trying

to step outside my comfort zone

I hunted down a nun

I ate foods that I hate

Have you ever tried Rigelian rutabagas

Because they are horrible
so dont seriously

But these are like little baby steps

and I feel like I really need
to challenge myself

Maybe I could volunteer in Astrometrics

or study medicine

I dont know Seems to make you happy

CHUCKLES

It might be a good idea
to clear your mind

before you make any choices

That is that is exactly the problem

My mind doesnt clear And then now

with all this DMA craziness going on

its like

You know Dr Kovich came to me

looking for a Discovery crew member

to lead some cadets
in a teambuilding exercise

Hes consulting with Starfleet Academy

Believes we have
something special to offer

since we served in a time
before the Burn

How would I justify bailing
on Commander Stamets

to go lead an exercise

The captains requiring everyone
to take some downtime

This would count as yours

Go Get inspired

Okay

Mm heres hoping

You know come to think of it

can you do me a favor when you go

Why is Tilly ordering me to go
on a training exercise

for cadets

Im already an ensign

Starfleet Academy is awesome

CHUCKLES

Try and think of it

as part of your responsibility as host

Your supposed to add new
experiences to your symbiont

Yeah but Jovar taught
at the Academy before the Burn

So really Tals already
got that experience

GRAY Theres always
something new to learn

And besides orders are orders

All right Well what are
you gonna do today

You know other than
the zhiantal exercises

Mind and body connection is everything

especially when you have a new body

But then I really want to check out

the crew games theyre planning
in the forward lounge

You barely know anyone

Ill walk in say hello

Now I know someone Easy

Youll do the same with the cadets

Im sorry have you met me

CHUCKLES Cant have soup
without scanning it first

CHUCKLES SOFTLY

I dont really know
how to do new without you

So this is your chance to learn

Okay Im going

Or tomorrow maybe

Tomorrow I think LAUGHS

MAN OVER PA Discovery shuttle

you are cleared for landing

INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA

Ah Kovich to the right

Lieutenant Tilly Ensign Tal

Welcome back to Starfleet Academy

Thank you sir
Its an absolute honor uh

Honestly never thought Id be
asked to do anything like this

I was I was the kid in class
who was asked to stop talking

Front row hand up thats me

KOVICH Ensign Tal

Youll be on shuttlecraft 

The other cadets are waiting there

Why dont you introduce yourself

YYes sir Sounds good

WOMAN OVER PA Cadet Cho report

Thank you for letting me
bring Adira along

Uh Dr Culber thought
it could be beneficial

They could use a little work
in the teambuilding department

Its a problem were seeing with
all of our Starfleet cadets

Thats why Im consulting

They may be the best their worlds have to offer

but they grew up isolated and disconnected

Many of them find it hard to function as a team

with individuals they dont already know

especially those of species
theyve never encountered

But with the DMA

Starfleet needs personnel
now more than ever

but if people cant even
work together

Precisely

One might say that todays exercise is

about the very future of Starfleet

WOMAN OVER PA Starfleet cadets

Youll do great Lieutenant

TILLY Todays exercise will be

a typical survey mission

Lieutenant Callum will be
taking us to Geryon

which is an Mclass desert
moon orbiting Theta Helios

Uh once there we will carry
out a full planetary analysis

Yes

CHUCKLES So fun

I think its fun

I mean its new worlds new things

Like Hey whats that
Is that a new lifeform What

Amazing

So okay oonce we arrive
well have six hours

uh at which point
well need to rendezvous

with the USS Armstrong

uh before heading back
to Federation Headquarters

So you guys have been at the Academy

for a couple months now

You probably know each other
pretty well at this point huh

Um not really

Academics keep us pretty busy

TILLY Well this is a
teambuilding exercise

so um Ill start

Hello I am Lieutenant Sylvia Tilly

I was born on Earth

I do remember
my first training exercise

Um I dropped my utility kit
down a methane gas vent

TILLY CHUCKLES

Whos next

Anyone else

Well be dropping out
of warp in one minute

In that case

I should probably just give
you guys your assignments

Okay Ensign Tal Magnetospheric

Cadet Harral Geological

Cadet Sasha Microbial

And Cadet Gorev Atmospheric

Um I sort of thought that youd be

bringing me as your aide

You know to keep an eye
on the students

make sure they dont drop
anything down a methane vent

Yeah I think actually for
this exercise its more useful

for you to think of yourself
as another cadet

You still have a lot to learn

 RUMBLING
 ALARM BLARING

 Whats happening
 Weve been hit by a rogue gammaray burst

Engines are offline
Helms not responding

Everybody hold on to something

Im a trained pilot I can help

No Sasha sit down Thats an order

TILLY No

GASPING SOFTLY

USS Armstrong Come in

Armstrong this is Starfleet
Lieutenant Sylvia Tilly

We are on a training mission
Acknowledge

I think the gammaray burst
wouldve knocked out the comms

ELECTRICAL WHIRRING

Lets see where we are

Shouldnt this be a desert moon

We were headed for Geryon Mclass moon

This is

This is Kokytos Lclass moon

We landed on the wrong moon

Lclass is breathable
but environmentally hostile

Okay come on This is
obviously part of the exercise

Were in a holo simulation right

No

Im sorry I wish I could say yes

This is real This is happening

The emergency distress beacon

that wouldve activated upon impact

Right So um Gorev

You check life support systems for me

Sasha you said youre a pilot right

See if you can get some
flight systems back on line

Harral youre with me

Were gonna get
longrange comms back on

Ill try to get sensors working

Good thank you

 GRUNTS
 Hey watch it

 You see me working here
 ADIRA Hey

Hey this is not the time

 Stay out of it
 Hey hey Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

No no no no
Were not doing this No

Hey hey hey hey hey Calm down

It is gonna be okay Okay

Once we get systems back on line

we will call the Armstrong

 Theyll pick us up
 Theyre not expecting us for six hours

A lot can happen in six hours

Okay uh you know what

but we are doing it now while we work

Got it

Harral on comms now

Adira

Adira you go first
Uh tell us about yourself

Um Im Im Adira Tal

I grew up on a generation ship

Great Sasha you next Go ahead

Val Sasha

Grew up in a colony on Titan

And coming to the Academy was

the first time Id met
any nonhumans before

Gorev

Taahz Gorev

After the Burn

my family was stranded

We werent treated very well

HARRAL Harral

Which means I have to work twice
as hard to be taken seriously

GROWLS

If you check my file
youll see Im top of the class

Right Good

Now we all know each
other a little better

 CLAPS
 Go team

 

INDISTINCT CHATTER

AIDE Sir

It appears you have a fan Saru

CLEARS THROAT

RILLAK Friends colleagues

The last four months have seen

a series of summits such as this

and it is my great privilege to say

that we have now come to the
end of this historic process

The Federation has reviewed the
final points of the Agreement

We are fully satisfied

and prepared to welcome NiVar
back into the Federation

President Rillak

we too are glad to be nearing
the restoration of our alliance

However there is one final
matter we must discuss

The reality of
the gravitational anomaly

and the threat it poses to our galaxy

has shifted many things recently

For all of us

I am aware that this will
come as a surprise

However we will require
an amendment to the Agreement

allowing for NiVars immediate
and unconditional withdrawal

from the Federation
should the need arise

MURMURING

An exit clause

Im sure you are also aware
this is unprecedented

Madam President I must
remind you that before the Burn

NiVar and other worlds

felt the Federation had grown
so disconnected from its members

that it was unable to consider
their individual needs

Trust was eroded

The repercussions are still being felt

We cannot accept a rejoining

without measures in place
that protect us

from such a situation arising again

This is a different time
Madam President

Be that as it may we stand firm

RILLAK The Federation would
never force any world

to remain a member

NiVar is proof of that

However unconditional
withdrawal is not acceptable

That would give NiVar
all the benefits of membership

while the Federation would bear

all of the risks associated
with its exit

Furthermore such a precedent
would allow other worlds

to request similar clauses

A weaker Federation would result

TRINA It is illogical
to rejoin an organization

that seeks to impose
conditions on our judgment

Perhaps we have moved
too quickly in these talks

 If I may
 MURMURING

MURMURING STOPS

With the tremendous strides
made to reach this point

its illogical to forfeit
over one issue

NiVar has endured
without the Federation

for a century

We will continue to do so

BURNHAM Madam President

There is a difference
between enduring and thriving

President TRina

may I propose a recess

Very well

MURMURING

The objections President TRina
raised have existed

for over a hundred years

Its not just the DMA
something else is going on

Talk to her and
see if you can find out what

Politics are not our place

Join me Captain

CULBER I know this was Michaels idea

How do you feel about that

The mind meld helped

Im fine

She says youre still not sleeping

Perhaps we could talk about that

Its Grudge Yeah

Shes been especially needy lately

Oh its a rough life

CHUCKLES SOFTLY

You ever been to a standing funeral

El muerto parado

No

Its an uh

an uncommon Earth tradition
but one my family practiced

When a family member dies
their body is embalmed

and then posed in a position
that best evokes their life

My um tío Cesar was
this infamous card shark

And so my family wanted to
place him at a poker table

And it was all going fine

till my cousins and I
snapped off his thumb

trying to place the cards in his hand

What did you do

I used all my medical training
and I reattached it

And then broke off
his index finger LAUGHS

We couldnt stop laughing
that whole funeral long

CHUCKLES

I didnt expect that

Well in conventional therapy

Im not supposed to share
personal things but

as crewmates we already know
too much about each other so

Sometimes the personal helps

Look I get it Grief is complicated

It takes many forms

I need to let myself experience it

however it comes right

I was devastated when my tío died

I was so angry

and I went to that funeral determined

that nothing was gonna
make me feel better

If youre willing Id like to
try something different

with our remaining time

As long as I can keep my fingers

Mm

CHUCKLES SOFTLY

SARU President TRina

Thank you for
the traditional Kelpien tea

I thought you might enjoy
a taste of home

I am dismayed the situation is
so difficult

If I can be of assistance
you need only ask

Many would be happy to see NiVar

and the Federation rejoined

myself included

I too share this sentiment

But I am bound first and foremost

by obligations to my own people

There is nothing more I can do

if the Federation is
unwilling to compromise

Of course

I understand

Now if you will excuse me

I intend to use the remaining
recess for meditation

RILLAK These are delicate matters

President TRina and I are
not just representing ourselves

but also a whole host
of other interests

There must be a way to compromise

All eyes are on us Captain

Were I to offer a compromise
it would project weakness

Listen to me well

My hands are tied

With no other options

it would seem that we are done here

 

I think President Rillak wants us

to find a solution to this mess

I felt something similar
from President TRina

This summit has become
political theater

Im sure of it

That must be why she found

a way for us to be here today

to cut through that

Then you do not believe that
Admiral Vance fell ill

Do you

Why us

Thats what we have to figure out

TILLY Okay where are we at

Ive managed to stabilize
life support at 

All flight systems are fried

 We cant fly
 Well uh what about comms

Checked every channel every frequency

 Nothing
 Yeah well just keep trying then

Theta Helios has moons
Without comms

hows anyone supposed to find
a meter shuttle

And we only have three days
of emergency rations

Okay Freaking out wont help

Okay Ive lived enough lives
to know this could be worse

 so let
 Thanks Admiral I feel so much better now

Okay Ensign how are
the sensors coming

 ELECTRICAL WHIRRING
 Theyre back on line

but Im getting some weird readings

The proximity scans show
there are thousands

of lifeforms just outside

And they seem to be gathering

RUMBLING AND RATTLING

ALL GRUNT

What the hell is that

 RUMBLING
 GROWLING

GASPS SCREAMS

Whatever it is

its not good

Somebody get a tricorder out
What are we looking at

Uh its a Tuscadian Pyrosome

Its a its a colony species made up

of thousands of
interconnected zooid lifeforms

It primarily preys on uh
bioluminescent crustaceans

uh tracking them via
electromagnetic signatures

Thats the same signature
used by our equipment

 GROWLS
 YELPS

No no no Put it down

Shut down your gear
Turn off all the equipment

 It cant see us with our equipment off
 WHIRRING

 RUMBLING
 GROWLING

GROWLING IN DISTANCE

BREATHING SHAKILY

Did it go away

If it did itll be back

What do we do now

ADIRA We cant use comms

We will freeze before anyone
figures out whats happened

Okay We got to get out of this valley

There is a ridge up there

If we can get up there

we can catch a signal
and use our personal comms

to contact the Armstrong

And well have a vantage point

if we need to see
the jellyfish from hell

before it gets to us

 You want us to go across all that
 Yeah

Theyre not ready for this

Ill go alone

II can move fast

and I will work better on my own

No I can do it
I have survival training

No youre both crazy
We should stay put

Let them risk their lives if they want

No one is going anywhere alone

Whatever we do from now on
we are doing it together

Lets move

Damn it Doesnt look like anything yet

SIGHS

This is a waste of time

Take a breath

Try again

You think I dont know what this is

 What is it
 A sad attempt to try

and replicate KweitholumKwei

KweitholumKwei

The Kwejian healing ritual
This is nothing like it

How is it different

Were healed by our planet

For KweitholumKwei you need sand

from the bed of the Mameckxsha River

You need to ask the Tulí Forests
for their blessings

You need the Great Storms
of Naillemkwai to make

That is programable matter
made to look like sand

because youre nothing
but cheap tricks that you got

from reading a damn holoPADD

You think youve substituted my home

with this rubbish

Itll never be the same
Itll never work

It wont be the same

Of course not

Kwejian was

one of the most beautiful
places in the known galaxy

Its loss is devastating

Profound

And you wont heal
the way you wouldve before

You will never feel

the relief of KweitholumKwei again

I dont know how much
longer I can take this

CHUCKLES

How long am I supposed to do it

A longass time

CHUCKLES

DOOR CHIMES

Enter

Thank you for seeing me

Of course but I must ask

have you come as a friend

or a representative of the Federation

No I am here of my own volition

while Captain Burnham seeks
audience with President Rillak

We believe she will
reconsider her position

I have been meditating on a question

Is trust of anothers commitment

to a shared goal enough
despite the scars of history

Trust is a journey

The anomaly has ignited old
and new fears alike

Some have responded with
a turn toward isolationism

including the Vulcan Purists

In return for their support
which is vital to my coalition

they have demanded a logical framework

to hold the Federation accountable

This exit clause provides it

Oh

Thank you for trusting me

I will leave you to your thoughts

But

if youll permit me another time

I would like to learn more
about your meditative technique

May I ask why

You weigh questions of politics

I weigh questions of place

purpose

In such uncertainly
as we are all experiencing

Im finding it much more challenging

than I had anticipated

Place your hands out palms up

 

It is called a threshtor kashek

It means shared mind

The type of meditation
we teach our children

while they are learning

Close your eyes

 

Your eyes are meant to remain closed

Captain Saru

Take a deep breath

TAKES DEEP BREATH

Lieutenant Christopher connect
me with the president please

OVER COMM Aye Captain One moment

What is it Captain

 Were preparing to leave orbit
 Then Ill be direct

Mr Saru is working
to get President TRina

back to the table

When she returns

we have to be prepared
with a compromise

Well I have a proposal

What could you suggest

that we havent already considered

Weve been at this for four months

At the end of the day

we both know that politics
comes down to votes

which is why you and President
TRina are taking positions

that have been agreed upon
by your respective delegations

Neither of you can budge
from those positions

or youll lose the support you need

But if a third party presents
a compromise

now you are not budging

Now youre just listening

All right Captain What have you got

WIND HOWLING

Keep an eye out for the pyrosome

CRACKLING

Okay What the hell was that

Spider lightning

Its a lightning that
travels kilometers

We dont want to be anywhere
near that when it strikes

Youve seen this before

No but Kasha Tal did and
barely lived to talk about it

GROWLING IN DISTANCE

I see it The creature
coming right beh

HARRAL What the hell




    

SCREECHING SNARLING

Damn things hunting us

It cant see us with our equipment off

But we got to keep moving
to stay ahead of this storm

 CRACKLING
 RUMBLING

GOREV But the lightnings
rolling in too fast

 We wont make it to the ridge
 If we pick up the pace

we can get there ahead of the lightning

 Stop acting like you are the expert
 Calm down

You dont know any more about
this moon than the rest of us

Were too exposed out here

We need to find a cave
and uh ride out the storm

Oh theres a genius idea

Lets trap ourselves in
a cave make it easier

for the monster to corner us

We dont have time
to stand around and argue

 All right Im going
 This is ridiculous

 If theyre going Im going too
 What about sticking together

Adira stop Stop it All of you

Listen you know Im usually
a very upbeat person

bubbly some would say

But right now I have one job
its keeping all of you alive

 So were staying together
 CRACKLING

Adira

I cant move

ADIRA Im stuck

 I cant get out
 Stay still youre okay

Youre okay

SCREECHING

We have to do something
before that gets here

Uh okay okay

Give me the emergency kit Now Come on

Here Adira grab it You got it

Okay everybody grab a piece

Sasha you grab them You got it

One two three pull

 ALL GRUNTING
 Pull

 Pull
 Almost

Keep going Heave

Pull

 Keep going Come on
 SASHA Its working Dont let go

 We got you
 Keep going Almost there

 Almost
 Almost there

Keep going Closer Almost

Keep going Keep going keep going

 Got you
 ALL GRUNTING

You you good

You good Okay

Okay good we got this

The ridge is right there
We can make it

Once we turn the comms on
that thing will sense us

Listen we can do this

We just have to work together as a team

The same way we just did for Adira

Sure as hell would be easier

if we didnt have to count on an Orion

 Hey
 Im just saying

he wanted to hide in a cave

 Thats what were trained to do
 Just admit it

 We seek shelter
 You only look out for yourself

Hey enough Enough

The Burn is in the past all right

You got to decide now

are we gonna work together
as a crew or not

When I was ten
an Emerald Chain raiding party

commandeered my familys
food replicators

because they could

I watched my grandmother
starve to death

I had to bury the body because
my parents were too weak

from giving me their food

Now you expect me to work with him

I hear you

Have you ever asked him about

his history with the Chain

Tell him

There is common ground here

but youll never find it
unless you talk to each other

Uh his father was Bashorat Harral

What

WhWhos that

Uh he was an activist

He drafted the Emancipation
Bill for the enslaved

which was part of the armistice
that the Emerald Chain

eventually proposed to the Federation

He died a political prisoner

before he could see any of that happen

My father always said
being an Orion meant

we had an even greater responsibility

to speak out against
what the Chain was doing

Sorry for

shutting you down earlier

The cave wasnt a bad idea

Thats good

Thats really good you guys

Youre talking We need
so much more of that

Right now we need to make it
to that ridge Right

You with me

 Yeah
 Yes

Come on guys youre Starfleet
now Its Aye

ALL Aye

TILLY Nice work cadets
Lets go Move out

BURNHAM The fact that you are both here

means you are ready to look forward

That has never been in dispute

Yet youre allowing past
mistakes to define that future

Logic dictates that the lessons we learn

should inform our choices

Choices are never
purely logical are they

Theres always emotions

If I may reference my own history

the Culling of my family my ancestors

It will always be a personal
challenge for me

to trust the Baul

Yet I cannot deny that
Kaminar is far stronger

now that it is united

And couldnt the same
be said about NiVar

The divisions between
the Vulcans and Romulans

were so vast and lasted
so many millennia

that they forgot they were
the same species

Even your ancestry
is a testament to hope

The Cardassians waged war
against Bajor and humanity

and now today all three are at peace

Because they were willing
to grow and change together

Your words are inspiring

Captain Burnham

But words alone are not sufficient

I understand that you and Captain Saru

are here to propose a compromise

BURNHAM We are

Within Starfleet disputes between

highranking officers can be
resolved by a committee

whose sole purpose
is to provide objectivity

and guide both parties to a resolution

We propose a committee independent

of Federation leadership
to conduct regular reviews

with all member worlds

Not just NiVar

NiVar has already refused any oversight

that does not include
one of its own citizens

Is that any more egregious
than insisting Starfleet

be given a voice
within a civilian quorum

BURNHAM If you would

allow me to serve on this committee

I am a citizen of NiVar
trained in logic

witness to your history

and I am an officer in Starfleet

Captain of a starship
and citizen of the Federation

I will be the bridge between you

until you no longer need it

This proposal is acceptable
to the Federation

It is an elegant solution

 

The storm will interfere with
our personal transporters

so itll take at least
seconds for the Armstrong

to get a lock and beam us up

CREATURES HOWLING

I hope they can hear us

 They have to
 They will

seconds is long enough
for it to get to us

We have to distract it

Im gonna turn on my comms
and Im gonna run

 Draw its attention
 Thats a terrible idea

Agreed

Okay you guys saved my life
All right I owe you

And someones got to do it
You know Im right

TILLY Yeah

You are right You are right

Someones got to do it
so its gonna be me

 Wait
 Thats an order ensign

Once Im clear you turn on comms

You call keep calling Dont stop

You got this

Weve all got this okay

Now on my mark

TILLY Are you ready

CADETS Aye Lieutenant

The minute you get a signal
call the Armstrong

SCREECHING

ADIRA Adira Tal

to USS Armstrong Come in

Armstrong acknowledge

Okay no Its too close to her
We have to help

Fire phasers to draw it off

SCREECHING

Holy shit Here comes the other one

 Theyre coming right at us
 Keep firing

ADIRA Armstrong
acknowledge Please acknowledge

IMAHARA This is Captain Imahara of the USS Armstrong

 Its them
 Armstrong get us the hell out of here

Armstrong

INDISTINCT CHATTER LAUGHTER

MAN OVER PA Ensign Moore please report to briefing room seven

Ensign Moore

 briefing room seven
 I just finished reading

the Armstrongs report

The loss of Lieutenant Callum
is a tragedy

Frankly ImIm amazed
any of you survived

Well the cadets
really pulled it together

when it mattered

Honestly any of them would be

an excellent addition to any crew

And when that opportunity comes

theyll have you to thank for it

You know when Discovery first arrived

no one here trusted you

It wasnt just that you were
in a yearold starship

and had never heard of the Burn

it was the way you carried yourselves

like you grew up in
a world that believes

anything is possible

Quite frankly itit stung

And is exactly what this new generation

of cadets needs
as the Federation rebuilds

Well after what youve just endured

I can understand that an offer
to teach at the Academy

is unlikely to fall on willing ears

but the opening is there

Anytime

Thank you sir

I never thought that Id say this

but I think that Im glad I came

II just I

I think I might have actually
made some friends today

I wish I knew how to do it

without nearly getting eaten by a blob

but

You know you are one of the
most brilliant people

that I have ever met

Do you ever wonder why
you start with I cant

when it comes to making new connections

 Just seems kind of impossible
 Well

when I see you and I see everything

that you have been through

and accomplished

youre a reminder to me
that everything is possible

Welcome home Madam President

Thank you President Rillak

Billions of futures have been changed

thanks to what weve done here today

I must commend both of you
on a job well done

Madam President thank you
for taking this first step

with the Federation

If I may

theres a matter on my mind

You are curious about
the Qowat Milat sister JVini

if she will face justice
for her actions

Yes maam

JVini will go to Pijar

a monastic world in the Pella system

There she will devote herself to
deep rehabilitative meditation

under your mothers careful guidance

They leave tonight

My mom said she had big news for me

JVini helped rebuild
Dr Burnhams life

Now it seems their roles are reversed

In time she will also
make amends to the family

of the slain Starfleet officer

I hope this sets your mind at ease

Thank you

Captain Saru

Will you join me for tea

It would be my pleasure

For someone who dislikes politics

you show an aptitude for it

I assume the admiral
made a miraculous recovery

Well now that you mention it
he was looking well better

last time I saw him

Hmm

I received a piece
of intelligence this morning

indicating the exit clause
request was coming

I had to protect my source

President Trina

Mmhmm

SIGHS

If you wanted my help
you could have just asked me

Truth be told

I wasnt sure you were
the right person for the job

But Im glad you were

I appreciate that

I know transparency
isnt always possible

in your position

But it is what I need to best serve you

and the Federation

So if you could be more
forthcoming in the future

I would appreciate that as well

Understood Captain

I will see you back at
headquarters in a few days

 

Wow

Guess Ive got a lot to work out

What do I do with it

Well when the mandalas
finished its

 wiped away

You do this yourself

Are there

are there things you need to wipe away

Sure

You want to talk about it

Someday

 DOOR CHIMES
 Come

I heard about what happened
on the mission

How are you doing

You know crash into an ice moon

stranded in an electrical storm

chased by a fleshmelting alien so

 typical day
 LAUGHS

I know theres been
something on your mind

We havent really sat in here together

since you became captain

Right

Remember when we first
became roomies LAUGHS

I was so scared to bunk
with a famous mutineer

I think I like I think
I laid awake at night

because I was scared
you were gonna like

knife me in the back or something

Well you snored like crazy

 GASPS
 I had to get the computer

to block out the frequency
so I could get any sleep

So sorry

I only blocked it out for a few days

and then I

I kind of started liking it

Really

 Really
 Youre weird

You want to go back dont you

I do

Why

Because getting my lieutenant pips

was the worst day of my life

You know II never could figure out

how my mother became a diplomat

She was such a hardass at home

No compromise She had
everything planned out

She had my whole life planned out

So when I told her that
I wanted to join Starfleet

instead of the diplomatic corps sh

So I always thought that
I was doing this for me

But then when I got the pips

all of a sudden I realized like

my mom is years in the past

Shes never gonna see me wear them

And I started wondering

if this is what I really
wanted or if I just

really wanted to be seen

You know And that was humbling

But I think it could be
a useful perspective

for a teacher

Well

 Ill miss seeing your face every day
 No

Its not forever
Youll still see me around

 Fed HQ
 Right

And then you know if its really bad

I can get Zora to record me
while Im sleeping

so you can listen to me snoring
like I know you love to do

I said I kind of liked it

You know you love it

BOTH LAUGHING

Lets not get crazy
