Welcome back to Starfleet Academy

You want to go back dont you

I do

 

You are doing a tremendous job Doctor

Serving as medical officer

and ships counselor cannot be easy

Until I know what the DMA is

I cant predict its behavior

Im gonna figure this thing out

For you

Whatever it takes

MALE This is USS Janeway
on approach with the DMA

Were picking up massive ionic fluctuations

Any other vessels in the area Confirm

FEMALE NSS TPau here

Confirming the same

Im also getting a strange spike in Xray radiation

MALE What is

TPau are you seeing this

FEMALE I am

FEMALE  What the hell just happened

The DMAs just

Its gone

You talking to yourself again

or you looking
for some sort of response

The DMAs gone from the Venari sector

It just It disappeared

Thats impossible

Nothing in space just disappears

And its back

The DMA reappeared  seconds later

 lightyears away

Can we confirm its the same DMA
weve been studying

The scan data matches exactly

And the odds
of an identical anomaly forming

are essentially nil

SARU Not to mention

natural phenomena do not disappear

and reappear elsewhere

Doesnt that violate
the laws of physics

Every law we know of that is

Zora

crossreference all historical
records in the sphere data

Are there any indications
that this could have been due

to some kind of natural event

Negative Captain

If this isnt natural

the only logical explanation

is someone created it

 

Who

Who would do this

BURNHAM Its now on a path

toward the Radvek asteroid belt

Its formerly an Emerald Chain colony

Its inhabited primarily
by the Akaali species

The current heading of the DMA
puts it right at the edge

of the impact zone

One degree one way or another could lead

to safety or death

STAMETS Problem is
we wont know if itll hit

until after interference from
the DMAs dark matter signature

has already made transport impossible

So weve got to get
everyone offworld before then

 How long do we have
 Four hours

Thats the cutoff point sir

Begin evacuations immediately

They may not be
Federation members but

were the only body with the ability

to execute a mission of this size

Ill send every vessel in the area

and Ill need Discovery
to jump there too

Ill lead the operation myself

SARU Admiral iif I may

are there plans to address
the panic that may arise

as it becomes known this is
not a natural phenomenon

President Rillak is meeting
with planetary leaders right now

to get ahead of it

Ah I am relieved to hear that

Ive already received a call
from the Kaminar High Council

Thethe fear in their voices
was unmistakable

They are desperate for answers

We all are

Most important being

whos behind this anomaly

Federation Security has identified

a number of civilizations

that may possess technology
this advanced

The Metrons the Nacene

the surviving members
of the Iconian empire

The Q Continuum were considered as well

But as there has been no
contact for years

and this is unlike anything
theyve done before

we dont believe its them

For now were classifying

those responsible
as Unknown Species TenC

SARU The C

BURNHAM Admiral it seems to me

the first step would be
to figure out how the DMA works

Then we can trace the
tech back to its creators

whoever they are

Thats my thought exactly

Which is why Ive asked Ruon Tarka

to advise us Hes been heading a number

of our scientific endeavors

Including the next generation
spore drive

if Im not mistaken

Hes working with Aurellio on that one

They still havent solved
the navigator problem

So without me or Book its useless

If anyone can find a way its Tarka

His expertise will serve us
well with the DMA too

With all due respect

I already have the people I need

Between myself and the other
task force scientists

We require someone at
the bleeding edge of Federation

and nonFederation technology
Commander

Im sure youll find him
a valuable asset

Hell board Discovery immediately

You can get him caught up on your work

Mr Saru

since you will have the conn

while Captain Burnham
leads the evacuation

please make sure Mr Tarka
gets whatever he needs

Yes sir

VANCE Keep me posted Captain

BURNHAM Yes sir

 

Were doing everything we can
to figure out the DMA

We need to do more Michael

We need to find out whos
behind this and stop them

We will We will Book

I know this isnt easy any of it

but lets focus on today

And what is possible

today right now

is saving lives on Radvek V

Let me help with that

Come on

I have to do something

At least I can make sure

no one else has to
go through what I did

Okay

Mr Saru status update

Uh three Federation ships
have reached Radvek V

And Ruon Tarka is now on board

I will see to him once
weve made the jump

All right

Lieutenant Christopher open
a shipwide channel please

Channels open

BURNHAM Attention all crew

our mission today
is to evacuate all inhabitants

of the Radvek chain

At this point we are not certain

whether the DMA will hit

What we do know is that in three and a half hours

all transport offworld will become impossible

So thats all the time weve got

We need to make sure
every minute counts

The inhabitants of Radvek V
are counting on us

Lets go save some lives

 

 

 

ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS

BURNHAM Whats the
situation on the ground

SARU There are  individuals

on the colonys surface to be evacuated

BURNHAM Lieutenant Christopher
contact the magistrate

Commander Nilsson have a team
prepare the Deck Four

loading bay for refugees

Well have them beam up
and then facilitate transport

 to the other ships
 Aye Captain

The array can only beam at a time

 Its gonna be close
 We do our best work when its close

Im quoting you by the way
That nitrium delivery on Oonla

Luckily this time
theres no noodle stalls

for you to blow up

Hey you were
on demolition duty Not me

CHRISTOPHER Captain

I have the magistrate on comms for you

Put him through

Magistrate Im Captain Burnham
of the USS Discovery

Thank Draylan youre here

We sent off all available ships

they held scarcely a quarter
of our population

All the rest are waiting
Theyve begun to panic

Ill send a team down to assist
We will get everyone out

SARU Captain we are
seeing six life signs

beneath the north dome generator

They are remaining stationary

far from the evacuation point

Are you aware of these individuals

Of course They are The Examples

SARU Records show

it is the colonys prison

They need to be evacuated immediately

Why Theyre criminals

Six offenders chosen to demonstrate

the costs of misbehavior

An Emerald Chain tradition

It has proven most effective
in preventing crime

It doesnt matter who they are
they dont deserve to die there

This is a Federation mission
Magistrate

No one will be left behind

Its too late The prison is automated

And the few who know
how to run it fled hours ago

The lawabiding among us await you

Mr Saru assemble a team
to help with the evacuation

Book and I will go
to the prison ourselves

RHYS Excuse me Captain

Id like to volunteer to lead
the evac team

I think I could be helpful

All right Commander

Take whoever you need and get going

SARU Captain the prison

is protected by a pattern interrupter

which prevents both transport and comms

within a halfkilometer radius

BURNHAM Understood

Lets go

Hi

Ruon Tarkas here to work with me

figured I should put on a clean jacket

Apparently hes some kind of genius

Well see

Wait Ruon Tarka isnt he the one

Yeah building off of my research

and hasnt once made
the effort to reach out

Yeah Ive advised his team
on uh spore propagation

on not harming the JahSepp

Ive supplied them with
countless samples of my DNA

But Tarka is always too busy for me

He goes through Aurellio every time

How do I work with someone
who has zero respect

for professional courtesy

Let it roll off you

There are bigger things at stake here

Good luck Im off
to assist with the evacuees

Hey Youve already done what

like five therapy sessions today

Maybe you could take ten minutes
before you jump into one again

People need help Paul

Knowing that someone made the DMA

makes it all the more unsettling

For everyone

Can I give you some advice though

Im good Really

DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT

DOOR CHIMES

MALE  Ensign Jameson please report to Observation

So this is the USS Discovery

Its like walking onto an antique

Ah

Mr Tarka welcome aboard

Uh this is Commander Stamets

Nice to finally meet you

Aurellios told me all about you

And of course Ive studied
your work extensively

So much to admire and improve upon

So what are we waiting for
Lets get started

 DMA awaits
 Uh if you will both follow me

 Youre the first Kelpien Ive ever met
 Ah

You really do have the strangest feet

BURNHAM Burnham to Discovery

Were approaching the prison now

Well be passing through
the boundary marker

for the pattern interrupter
in just a moment

That will take us out of comms range

CHRISTOPHER Aye Captain Good luck

Rhys whats the status
of the evacuation

transported so far

Bit chaotic at first but
everythings going smoothly now

Good Book and I are going dark

Dont wait for us

Well be out of here
before the cutoff point

Captain thank you
for letting me do this

I can tell it means a lot to you

My town was wiped out
by a hurricane when I was five

A Starfleet crew got us out

So I get what this is like for them

Im glad youre here Commander

Lets do this

Okay the door is standard
Emerald Chain issue

I can open it no problem

 Such confidence
 What can I say

Im a man of many talents

Im not picking up any defense systems

There must be some

Yeah I dont trust it either

By the way about Oonla

you do realize it was either
the noodle stands

or the fusion reactor

Mmhmm I was picking noodles
out of my braids for days

CHUCKLES Simpler times

Constantly running for our lives doing

borderlinelegal courier gigs

 That was simpler
 In some ways

Though I dont miss the whole
just friends thing

I was keeping it professional

Which was absolutely zero fun
for either of us

CHITTERING

The hell is that

Its a Narisa beetle

Theyre indigenous to the Akaali

They must have brought them
when they settled here

 CHITTERING
 I could not hate that sound more

 You mean the chitin
 No idea what word you just said

Chitin The polysaccharides
in arthropod exoskeletons

It creates a distinctive clicking

Whatever It creeps me out

Says the man who finds
beauty in Tranceworms

Why cant you just ask it to go away

Im trying to I cant
communicate with it

Its taken the exact
same path four times now

No living thing is that precise

Lets see what were dealing with

Its a mobile land mine

Ive heard the Emerald Chain

use weapons like this
disguised as native life

Theres a lot more coming this way

These are scans from the precise moment

the DMA disappeared

It collapsed into a central aperture

What appears to be some sort
of uh technological device

Which then disappeared as well

We assume this is what also
is controlling the DMA

in its new location

The scans further indicate

the DMA left behind a subspace rupture

Yes yes yes

Ive already seen this data

Its inconclusive

Subspace damage can be created
by a litany of things

Of course I was about to say that

 but you cut me off
 For something so powerful

its an exceedingly blunt instrument

Uh we too have wondered
about its uh purpose

Is it a weapon perhaps

or uh clearing areas of space
in preparation for something

 Uh is it
 Wheres the replicator in here

That console

Make me a plate
of mashed potatoes cold

And a pea Just one

STAMETS Were on a clock here

 So if you need to eat something
 SHUSHES

TARKA These potatoes are the DMA

A mass of dark matter
and accreted material

moving through space wreaking havoc

controlled somehow by
the device at its center

What does it all add up to

You originally theorized
primordial wormhole

 Obviously thats wrong
 Had I known about the device

I didnt say completely wrong

The behavior of the anomaly

suggests that the wormhole is present

You think what synthetic

I think someone created a tunnel
through spacetime

 to get it here
 To what end

No idea

But we can sit around doing math

or we can get our hands
dirty and find out

I am not sure I follow
your metaphor Mr Tarka

I want to create a working
model of the DMA controller

Miniature scale of course

You really think you can do that

Take a look at the schematics
if you want

You want to create a device
that will generate a wormhole

 on Discovery
 Yeah simulations

are promising
but I need a realworld trial

to confirm my theory and collect
the data that we need

For instance how much
power will it require

Does it rupture subspace

Those answers will help lead us
to whos responsible

STAMETS Wow this is

It really could work

WWe can enclose both ends
of the wormhole

inside a containment field

Itll be perfectly safe

I will give Commander Nilsson the conn

and personally supervise

CHUCKLES Were gonna
need a bigger room

Cant hold them off forever

They communicate using
a shared control matrix

I can access it to stop their movements

but I need you to buy me more time

More time she says

You have got to be kidding me

 Come on Michael
 Im almost done

BOOK Now would be good

Got it

I told you I could do it

Never doubted you

Clocks ticking We have
to get those prisoners out

Come on

METAL CREAKING

BURNHAM Everyone up please
We need your attention

Who the hell are you
And whats with the costume

Im Captain Burnham
of the USS Discovery

This colony is in the path
of a gravitational anomaly

The other colonists are being
evacuated as we speak

so we are here to evacuate you

Now we know why the guards took off

They left us here to die

FELIX Of course they did

Tell me why would a Starfleet
captain come to help us

Because the Federation
doesnt leave prisoners to die

Is that so

Everyone here is sentenced to life

no matter how small their crime

He stole food for his family

He traded in counterfeit latinum

She counted cards at a tongo club

And Felix took one joyride
on a sandcopter

Tell me how thats worth
years and counting

This is not a place of justice

And the Federation
has done nothing about it

This was Emerald Chain territory

We had no jurisdiction

So now you care

We did then and we still do

We dont have time for this okay

We need to get everyone out

How long before
this gravitational anomaly hits

In a little over an hour

we lose the ability to transport

We wont know its trajectory
until after that

So it may not hit us

Thats right The plan is to beam you

onto our ship until its safe

Listen we are risking
our own lives being here

Can we get moving

Good Where is
your prison control system

On the basement level

But it has biometric protections
that only the guards can access

LUDA What about the
force field generator

Shut it off our walls go down

That

DEVICE TRILLS

The casing is quanarium alloy

Its one of the strongest
metals there is

Its also an excellent heat conductor

Kvalue of 

If we heat it up
we could fry the system

PHASER FIRING

How long do you think itll take

I have no idea

 Dont tell them that
 PHASER FIRING

Im sorry we have to reschedule

There are others assisting
in your absence

You can spare ten minutes

You were the one who
requested this meeting

Yes sir but that was before
I knew about the evacuations

We have hundreds of refugees
coming on board

Im a busy man Dr Culber

I cleared the time for you

We both know how this works

We can skip the therapeutic niceties

What do you need

Well youre familiar with
my duties as ships counselor

And I saw how you were with Georgiou

when she was in crisis so

You need brutal honesty Noted

We now have eight and a half minutes

Well the DMA has brought up
a lot of uh

fear and uncertainty for the crew

So Ive

Ive offered them hope

I told them that uh
it wont last forever

that that well find
a way to stop it

SCOFFS

I recently worked with someone whose

entire world was destroyed

Mr Booker

I almost admitted to him that uh

Im struggling

And it made me realize
that uh Ive been lying

To everyone who gets in front of me

And now we find out that this
isnt an act of nature that

 that someone chose to kll

Someone with staggering power

And whether I lie or I dont

 I am failing

And you want me to affirm
that youre failing

because youre seeking
permission to take a break

SCOFFS

Thats not what I said at all

Yes it is

You know what This isnt helpful

 I got to go
 You died

You died and came back to life

Little wonder youre a mess

Your file is stunningly generic
as to your feelings

on this rather unique fact
of your existence

so allow me to fill in some blanks

Why me

Its the question you ask yourself

every morning and every evening

No one else gets
a second chance so why me

That led you to the idea

that there was a reason
for your survival

A purpose youre meant to
fulfill right here right now

And that led you to a savior complex

because if there is no reason
if there is no purpose

then your very existence
is a middle finger

to anyone whos ever lost someone

Which is everyone

Hows that for brutal honesty

Do you have a recommendation

to go along
with that sparkling analysis

Whether or not you were
a miracle Dr Culber

you are only human

You need to allow yourself time to rest

as you advise your patients

Well I cant just stop

Not now anyway

Its what I do Its

Its who I am Its

Its the way you escape

the persistent guilt of being alive

This is a uniquely
challenging time yes

But if you dont find
fulfillment in something

other than work
then you will fail those

in the chair in front of you

II have a  

Goodbye

BURNHAM Just a few more seconds

BOOK When this goes
we need to move fast

POWERING DOWN

I dont know about the rest
of you but no way

am I sitting in a brig on some ship

Im out of here

BURNHAM I cant let you do that

Its set to stun
but it still wont feel good

All the colonys ships are gone
Were your only way out

You cant ask us to trust you

and then treat us no differently
than our jailers do

Lower your weapon

What happens after you rescue us

Will we get our freedom

Because if we all walk out right now

wed have a chance at precisely that

Maybe for an hour if youre lucky

Maybe we will be

If the anomaly doesnt hit
we could use that time

 Find another way off this asteroid
 That is a big if

You havent seen this thing
You dont know what it can do

It destroyed my planet

They whoever they are

they dont care how many are klled

Im sorry for your loss

But it changes nothing for us

I want a guarantee

that we will not be returned
to this unjust society

Ill advocate for the diplomats
to put pressure

A guarantee or we go nowhere

TARKA Okay the controller
model is just ready to test

Activating containment field now

RENO I can just picture
Tillys face when she finds out

that we got sucked into a wormhole

three days after she left

I miss her too Commander

Were ready for power

Its what I do best

Now of course the big
difference here apart from size

is that the actual DMA controller

would have to use
an internal power source

Some sort of highly stable
energygenerating system

far beyond
our technological capabilities

But the rest of it I think Ive
nailed pretty much perfectly

RENO Here you go

QUIETLY Its working

 Incredible
 SARU That looks remarkably like the DMA

Theres nothing quite like the
rush of proving a theory right

I remember my first time
I was five years old

I atomized a live caracal

All anyone could do was complain
about how messy it was

I was never understood on Risa

The pleasure planet

I was surrounded by idiots

Felt like your Gaily Leo
at the Inquisition

You mean Galileo

Sure Why not

The point is great
intellect can be costly

 You know thats something we have in common
 Hmm

Your encounter with the Emerald Chain

Neural lock Painful

SARU EExcuse me

It appears the uh
experiment has paused

RENO Let me see what I can do

TARKA Oh I see the problem right here

Its gonna require much
more power than I thought

RENO Sorry Galileo

Im giving you all I can without taking

from the transport systems

Uh which is not an option

There are evacuations in progress

TTheres got to be

somewhere else we can pull from

Come on you love a challenge

I mean I could harness
the ionic radiation

from the main phaser array

converting it into a
temporary power source

Is that safe

Lets see if one is
nothing to worry about

and ten is insane I would say

its eh its probably a six

Great science was never
accomplished with caution

Im not sure thats actually true

Sir if we can understand this tech

then we can figure out who built it

And maybe even how to stop it

Every piece of data is a clue

Commander I do not believe
that you or Mr Tarka

are considering the risks
as seriously as you should

You realize its a choice
to be this tense right

Mr Tarka I have extraordinary
responsibilities on

SHOUTS

What was that

SHOUTS

Do it back

Excuse me

Yell back at me

What are you afraid of

 Do it
 BELLOWS

CHUCKLES

Well that was something

That felt pretty good right

Being out of control for a moment

I suppose it did




    

Look you may not like me

butbut I love me

And I am not gonna let
this experiment blow me up

Which means by extension

that your ship will be fine too

STAMETS Mr Saru

for the first time
since we discovered the DMA

were actually getting somewhere

Well keep this within safe parameters

Ill make sure of it

I will allow the additional power

but Commander Reno will give me
the ability to cut that power

should I deem it necessary

This is gonna be fun

BOOK Come on Michael
We have minutes

BURNHAM Okay I found something

I searched Starfleet General
Orders and Regulations

Protocol allows a captain
to grant political asylum

in extreme circumstances

That would bring you
under Federation law

Your cases would go under
immediate review

and your sentencing
would likely be commuted

How would we warrant asylum

The magistrate called you The Examples

Your sentences were political
theater they werent justice

And if you also believe that
to be true and you do want

your cases reviewed by the Federation

I just need you to say that right now

I want my case reviewed Absolutely

 So do I
 Me too

Then were done here

 Lets get moving
 Yes

Ill join you in a moment

What are you doing

Theres something I cannot leave

Whatever it is
its not worth it Wewe

It is to me

Unlike the others I do belong here

Im not the man they think I am

I took a life

You do not shrink from me

Im not here to judge you

FELIX When I took that life

I also took this

Its a lalogi orb

Theyre precious to the Akaali
Each family has one

It contains a record of their heritage

I kept it hidden from the guards
all these years

promising myself that somehow
I would return it

But of course now its too late

Ive devoted my life to doing
penance for my crime

One way is to help
the others here however I can

I know that giving them asylum
may create difficulties for you

but the right choice
is rarely the easy one

Thank you

We need to go

LUDA Lets do this

ALARM BLARING

LUDA Shit

It read my biometrics

Now were all trapped

Its reinforced with a layer
of nanomaterial

Theres no way we can
shoot through this

Were running out of time

 Any ideas
 No

Wait Those beetles

 Power them back up Maybe
 LUDA Whoa whoa whoa what

Why would you do a thing like that

Because we can use them
to blow open the door

 Right
 Everybody take cover

Im bringing them right to us

I thought youd think
this idea was too crazy

Oh it is I just dont
have a better one

 Think there are enough of them
 There better be

Ive got all of them coming Get ready

LUCA Theyre coming in

You have to stop them

BURNHAM Working on it

 Still never doubted you
 CHUCKLES

Okay maybe a little
Okay lets go lets move

GASPS

SARU Commander Rhys
what is your status

RHYS The evacuation is nearly complete

Two more groups to go

Have you heard from the captain

No Their comms are still dark

Complete your mission
then proceed to the prison

 to assist them
 Yes sir

We must finish the experiment now

I need to return to the bridge
as soon as possible

RENO Additional powers
been transferred

Divide it between the model
and the containment field

Go slow The more you feed the monster

the more you need the cage

I sent you the kll switch

In case the monster gets out of hand

Commander Stamets do the honors

Oh give it more

Bad news Containment fields weakening

Redistribute power to the field please

But that means taking it
away from the device

If the field should fail
the gravitational gradient

could destroy the ship

Commander Reno

Oh thats too much Its stalling out

Mr Saru we need to make
sure this device works

Its the only way to get
data on the real thing

TARKA Billions of lives
depend on this experiment

My people His Grumpy ladys

And all the lives on Kaminar too

I can control it

You may continue for now

Zora please provide realtime updates

on any decrease
in containment field integrity

ZORA Understood Captain Saru

RENO More power coming
to you Commander

Thats it thats it

Thats how it works

I was right

Its behaving exactly like the DMA

Look yeah gravitational lensing

and dark matter accretion

And its creating
a subspace rupture too

It needs more power to stabilize

STAMETS Its working

ZORA Containment field integrity dropping

Do you have the data
you need Commander

 
 Not yet

No give it a chance to stabilize

 
 Weve got this

Come on More

 
 More more

 Dont stop
 ZORA 

Commander Stamets

 No just a little longer
 

ZORA 

Ten percent

Five percent

Oh come on

This experiment is over

RENO That is the closest youve come

to killing us all and that
is really saying something

Commander Rhys come in

RHYS Captain weve been trying to reach you

Are the evacuations complete

 Yes
 Great

Head back to Discovery

Weve got things covered here Mr Saru

SARU Oh it is good to hear your voice

CHUCKLES Yours too
Five to transport

Stand by for more

Come on lets go

I needed to be sure
the others got out

 but Im staying

Six minutes left

Come on We need to go

I resolved to die here a long time ago

I wish to stay until my jailers return

or until the anomaly hits

 Thats insane
 Perhaps to you

I believe its part of my penance

BURNHAM No

Felix listen to me You have
years ahead of you still

You can live a different kind of life

That is not what I want

Its been a long day
Hes not thinking clearly

You could force me of course

But is it really your choice to make

This is where I committed my crime

This is where I need to remain

Whether my life is to end
in years or moments

it is my life

My debt to pay

Please do not take that from me

Its his choice to make

You said no one left behind

We have to respect his agency dont we

And let him kll himself

Its a risk not a certainty

And if you want to stay

Michael

We have to save him

I cant just

I am sorry

But the longer we debate this

were putting our lives
in danger And his

We can use this to communicate

And Ill tell you as soon
as Im sure of the trajectory

FELIX Before you go

I kept it safe for years

Now I ask you to do the same

I will

Im grateful

For everything

Book

This is wrong

BURNHAM Two to transport

BURNHAM Good work today everyone

We saved over a thousand lives

Captain scans have just confirmed

the asteroid belt will be
within the impact zone

Then well stay in comms
range as long as possible

Open a channel

Aye Captain

Felix can you hear me

Its coming isnt it

Theres too much interference to beam you up now

Im sorry

Dont be Im not

Id like to tell you what
happened what I did

if youd like to hear it

Ive never told anyone

Its not a burden I wish to carry beyond this life

Lieutenant Christopher please
raise the privacy barrier

No

Ive been behind walls long enough

 Whoevers there they may hear this as well
 Okay

years ago

I was a man with nothing

A stranger gave me shelter and a meal

I waited until he went to sleep

and I robbed him

He caught me in the act we struggled

I klled him

His child was in the other room

It wasnt until later

that I realized among the things I stole

was the familys lalogi orb

Not only did I take that
girls future from her

 I took her past as well

I think about her every day

How that must have changed her

How shes carried it with her

Do you know her name

The family was called Doxica

STATIC

CHRISTOPHER Weve lost comms Captain

 

Black alert

ALERT BLARES

Jump

Captain Burnham

I demand that the prisoners
be held in the brig

We will not share space with them

Under what authority
are you making these demands

I am the sovereign magistrate of

Of a colony that no longer exists

Those people are now under
Federation protection

and thereby subject to Federation law

 But
 As are you

as long as you are on this vessel

I need to remind you

that wherever you find a new home

youll be arriving as a refugee

seeking shelter and grace

I hope you find a more just society

than the one you had a hand in creating

Now if youll excuse me
I have a ship to command

DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT

So howd it go today

Uh the refugees are turning in
for the night

Resettlement begins tomorrow

How was your day

Oh uh crazy

We learned a lot

though not as much as we couldve

and um Tarka is a genius no question

but um he scares me too

He is so singleminded about his work

he cares about literally nothing else

Hmm

Actually feels a little familiar

How are you feeling

Fine

That was an avoiding fine
not a real fine

Your eyes are the tell

Really

You look down Every time

Kovich told me Im wearing myself out

Hes right

He said Im using work as a crutch

And that I need to take a break

Maybe thats why
I fell in love with you

We have the same pathology

LAUGHS SOFTLY

Making you either a total narcissist

or a glutton for punishment

Little column A little column B

Look at us

We jumped a thousand years
into the future

we helped solve the Burn

and we cant figure our own shit out

BURNHAM Zora have you found her yet

ZORA I have confirmed that the woman

you seek is on board currently at Deck Four

 Airlock Two
 Thank you

And Id like to offer my condolences Captain

I infer from microinflections in your voice

that you are experiencing sorrow

Its been a tough day

It can be painful to weigh duty against compassion

I wasnt aware you had
the operational parameters

to make an observation like that

The understanding and experience of emotion

naturally leads to feelings of empathy for others

You feel emotions

It is a recent development

SOFT WHOOSH

We have arrived

It was nice speaking with you Captain

With you too Zora

FEMALE Attention duty logs have been updated

to reflect new rotations effective immediately

BURNHAM Patri Doxica

 Im Captain Burnham
 Hello

I believe this may belong to you

I

I thought it was lost years ago

How did you 

Im helping someone keep a promise

This was my father

He was klled when I was a girl

Were meant to be added
to the tree when we come of age

I didnt have the chance

Now you do

LAUGHS SOFTLY

Thank you

I hope it continues to grow

for many generations to come

LAUGHS SOFTLY

I can smell synthehol ale
across the room

Here try some of the real stuff

Risian whiskey

Thanks

Youre Cleveland Booker
the other spore drive operator

I read your file

Ruon Tarka

You were working with Stamets today

Mmhmm

Also saw that colony
get ed into the sun

That was quite a show

At least you got everyone out

Yeah Almost

Almost was the story of my day too

I came this close
to something incredible

You know whos behind
the DMA dont you

LAUGHS You say that
with such confidence

A man only gets as close as you did

when he has some idea
whats over the cliff

So who made it

I dont know

Yet

But I couldve told you it
wasnt the Metrons

or the Nacene or the Iconians
well before I got here

So why the experiment

Why risk the lives of everyone on board

Science has many purposes

Try again

I constructed a model
of the DMA controller

at a scale of  times
to the negative th

This entire ship

couldnt provide enough
juice to keep it stable

Which means the actual device

has an energy source equivalent
to a hypergiant star

Unfathomable power

Maybe theyre gods

Whoever they are theyre not gods

And theyre sure as hell
arent immortal

So much anger no place to put it

You dont know me

No but I know anger

Its a wonderfully productive emotion

Nice to meet you Mr Booker
