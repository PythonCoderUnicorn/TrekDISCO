Previously on Star Trek Discovery

We got you Gray Well find
a way to help you be seen

truly seen

I cant believe I get
to start my life again

BURNHAM Book You there

BOOK I keep seeing him

Leto I dont know if he knew

if I ever let him know
how much I loved him

Im sorry

Im gonna figure this thing out
for you whatever it takes

TILLY Starfleet Academy feels like  years ago

Nothing feels simple anymore

Its okay to feel that way

I dont know if somethings off
or uh Im off

I was kind of hoping that we
could talk about it sometime

VANCE What exactly is this anomaly

STAMETS Were not certain

We know its there we know its moving

but we cant get a handle

on what it is

I offer the services
of the NiVar Science Institute

A crisis such as this
requires all to contribute

This anomaly threatens us all equally

We must all work together

 

This is Commander Fickett of the USS Credence

We have your dilithium shipment ready

WOMAN We are grateful to receive it Commander

It has been a long time

FICKETT Always happy to help

 Looking good
 Everything is ready Commander

 We have their coordinates
 Good work

Thank you Lieutenants

Computer lower the
shields for transfer

Locking on your coordinates now

 COMPUTER Security breach
 ALARM BLARING

GRUNTING AND GROANING

Commander

Stand down

ALARM CONTINUES BLARING

I need to take your dilithium

You can wait your turn
like everybody else

Im afraid thats not possible
Please step aside

Its not gonna happen

No

GROANS

Please my friend choose to live

YELLS

Im sorry

VANCE Fourth and most recent

in a string of identical
dilithium thefts

Killing a Starfleet officer though

thats new

The killer is a NiVar citizen

and a Qowat Milat nun known as JVini

Her cohorts are mercenaries

confirmed to be operating
under her orders

Thanks to the tracker we planted
in the dilithium she stole

we now have her coordinates

You said these thefts began

shortly after the gravitational
anomaly was discovered

Might there be a connection

As of now we have
no indication of motive

JVinis crimes however are clear

She must be detained without delay

BURNHAM This would
be an appropriate time

for the Qowat Milat to join us

Thank you President TRina

RILLAK Admiral NiVar is a
trusted ally of the Federation

Despite the fact that these crimes

were committed on Starfleet vessels

we will not respond
without NiVars guidance

Thank you

Indeed we are more than allies

It is my hope that
we will soon be united

under the flag of the Federation

The dangers posed by the anomaly
make our cooperation

all the more important

It is my understanding that

at the moment no inhabited
systems are threatened

by its trajectory yet it could
change course at any time

That is the case Madam President

Commander Stamets
has been leading the efforts

to better understand its movements

Hes eager to start collaborating

with the NiVar Science Institute

And they are ready to receive him

Here too we offer our services

This is an internal Qowat Milat matter

and as such we ask

that Starfleet turn
her coordinates over to us

We believe JVini most likely is acting

as a galankhkan
on behalf of a lost cause

VANCE Most likely

You have doubts

No

I have faith

Why would she steal the dilithium

The Federation is giving it away

I dont know This is the first news

weve heard of JVini in several years

But I trust she has a reason

The order must be allowed
to discover that context

Mom

She klled a Starfleet officer

You cannot excuse that with context

We do not excuse JVinis actions

However we must be
the ones to pursue her

I fear no one but her sisters

will be able to bring her in alive

The unique ways of the Qowat Milat

must be respected

RILLAK Admiral Vance

would Starfleet be amenable
to making this a joint mission

A venture of mutual goodwill
would reflect the spirit

of the pending union between
NiVar and the Federation

Under the circumstances

we would of course be amenable

As would the Qowat Milat

Well might I suggest Captain Burnham

be permitted to represent Starfleet

She has my confidence

And dare I say
the confidence of her mother

Whatever JVinis circumstances
I think we can all agree

that these actions cannot
be allowed to continue

Bring her in

Safely

Ill prepare to leave immediately

As will I

Captain

If we may speak frankly

Of course

This joint mission is
a political necessity

NiVar and the Qowat Milat
must feel respected

but make no mistake
you are in charge

I thought we landed
on mutual goodwill back there

Goodwill and leadership are
two different things

This anomaly

it is the biggest threat
we have faced since the Burn

This is our moment to serve

and to show why restoring
the Federation is so critical

We cannot do that without NiVar

But we also cant do it
if those who attack us

dont see our strength

JVini must be brought in

Absolutely

If you feel your relationship
with your mother will make this

 too difficult
 No

No JVini took the life
of a Starfleet officer

I will bring her to justice

I promise you that

Good Im counting on you

 

 

 

ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS

GASPS

No youre almost finished

I was gonna ask you a question
if you have a second

For you always

Oh thanks I really appreciate it

So um

TILLY GROANS

That was

disturbingly not delicious

Is something amiss with the replicator

No no I um

sorry ordered mac and cheese
on purpose

And theres something amiss with me

and Dr Culbers trying
to help me with it

Well while your dislike of cheese

certainly renders you a rarity
among humans

I was not aware it was
considered an actual

disorder

Oh no no its not Uh um Im sorry

I am trying new things

because my comfort zone
has become uncomfortable

Or too comfortable

Unclear

Anyway Dr Culber thought it might help

if I shake things up a little
so last night

I slept with my pillow
at the other end of my bed

and then I took the long way
to the bridge this morning

and I was hoping I could uh
try out a little gardening

by watering some of your plants

What is it you hope
to gain from novelty

To be honest Im not sure yet

I do keep thinking about
those cadets at the academy

and just how certain they are

that they are exactly
where theyre supposed to be

You know

And I used to have that

Clarity of purpose can
be difficult to achieve

Sorry I know youyou
have some places to go

Its not important

I confess to having dined quickly

I am speaking with Kaminar soon

Oh Well give SuKal my best

Oh He would appreciate that

However todays call is
with the local council

to discuss our role

in retrofitting Kaminars spaceport

My homeworld recently voted
to return to the stars

I will look for something
meaningfully unusual

for you to do

Till then you are welcome
to mist my plants

Oh but do take care
to not touch the swampkelp

while it is in bloom

Why What happens if I do

It is better if you do not know

Hey

Thought Id find you here

Stamets give you another job

Yeah Its more like
a tachyon treasure hunt

 CHUCKLES
 Not exactly in my wheelhouse

but it keeps me close to the action

Such as it is

Speaking of action mind
if I requisition your ship

Starfleet and Qowat Milat only

Yeah I see how it is

Love a man up and
leave him without a ship

I will return it washed and waxed

And I thank you

How is he

Hes got a new theory

Primordial wormhole

Primordial wormhole huh

Four out of five factors point to yes

Um one

Gravitational distortions are consistent

 with wormhole behavior
 Mmhmm

Two So is the shape
of the gravitational well

Three Its ability to change direction

Four It contains a massive
amount of accreted dark matter

Which reminds me

Ive given it a nickname the DMA

Dark Matter Anomaly

Too much of a mouthful
to say every time

Right

Everything points
to a primordial wormhole

except one missing factor

Let me guess tachyons

Always present
at the birth of a wormhole

Without evidence of tachyons

Were back to square one

The evidence is in here

I just have to find it

Until I know what the DMA is

I cant predict its behavior

And we cant prevent another

The NiVar Science Institute
will be a great help

Im uh sending the raw data now

Okay Keep me posted

I want to go to
the Science Institute with you

Oh uh

no no no you really wouldnt

Its gonna be so boring

Field equations Manifolds

Torsion tensors Math math math

I need to be doing something

SIGHS Helping Come on

I um

I cant bring these scientists
up to speed

without a clinical forensic discussion

of your loss

I can handle it

Thank you

EXHALES SHARPLY Its me

Almost

Ill finally be a part
of the world again

No more looking in from the outside

feeling invisible

The world has no idea
what its been missing

The crews gonna love you

I mean not as much as I do obviously

LAUGHS

Thank Dr Culber for me again

Wait a few minutes
and thank him yourself

In person

MAN Dr Culber

Guardian Xi is arriving

Guardian Xi welcome

I believe Ive prepared
everything you need

for the incorporation

An atypical arrangement

as befits zhiantara unlike any other

Adira Tal greetings

ADIRA Thank you so much

for doing this

It is my joy to assist

Do we have Gray Tal

LAUGHS Oh uh hes right here

Greetings

Um tell him that um

Im honored by his presence and

I couldnt be more
grateful for his help

LAUGHS Heshes really
grateful youre here

Guardians are kind of like his heroes

He was on his way to becoming one of you

before things went sideways

It is my hope that our work today

will allow you to resume your training

However your unique situation

is attended by unpredictable dangers

I cannot guarantee
that your consciousness

can find a new home in a synthetic body

without a hosts mind to guide you in

We must accept the possibility

that you could be lost

Tell him that

Im lost without this

I Ive been living
in an inbetween place

for too long already

I have to try

He understands the risks

Hes good to go

Do we have the consent of Tal

We do

Then let us begin

SARU It sounds difficult

Uhhuh My mother is bringing
a Qowat Milat sister with her

I should add a tactical officer
to balance the numbers

Cant have the mission
appear to favor either party

This mission would be straightforward

if it werent for the politics

Dont get me started on Rillak

Mm I will not

But I would like to offer a

a recommendation
for your tactical addition

Lieutenant Tilly

She has a long and
impressive list of skills

but combat falls kind of at the bottom

That may be so but Dr Burnham
and her Qowat Milat companion

are certain to be highly combat trained

as are you

Given the delicate nature of politics

you might consider making use

of Tillys intuitive diplomatic skills

She does have a way
of putting people at ease

I believe she may do the mission good

And it her

Hmm

TILLY But it can be a little hard to get out of your comfort zone

when you can barely get out

of the lab you know

So getting the opportunity
to do this this

this could be really good for me

Um Im so sorry Not that um

not that its good that
your sister is getting arrested

Obvi Obviously thats not

thats not good

Thatsthats bad
Thats not good at all

You worry that Im dismayed
by your enthusiasm

Im not

Absolute candor

I dig that

GABRIELLE You told me that when
Spock was accused of mrder

you didnt believe it

And your trust in your
brother was justified

Thats different I knew him

And I know her

Who is she to you

I need to know who Im dealing with

TAKES DEEP BREATH

When I first came to this future

I was broken

A Qowat Milat sister
nursed me back unwavering

for more than a year

Yes youve told me

That sister was JVini

I was once her lost cause

She gave everything to heal me

I owe her everything

COMPUTER Approaching destination

You need to leave your phasers on board

They are not the Qowat Milat way

We are not Qowat Milat

And theyll be set to stun

If you go in there with phasers
Ill never get through to her

You want to put us in front of
a member of your order unarmed

Thats not gonna happen

Did I say unarmed

Well be at a huge disadvantage

It was agreed that
the ways of the Qowat Milat

would be respected

SNICKERS

This is so outside my comfort zone

Its heavier than I expected

 Shwee Oh
 SWORD CLATTERS

Sorry So sorry

I moisturized my hands
this morning Apologies

But dont worry Ill be good to go

BURNHAM Good because

were here

TILLY Im not reading any life signs on the surface

Check under the surface

She has to be someplace around here

TILLY One inhospitable
uninhabited chunk of rock

makes as good a hideout
as any other so

why this one

Mom did JVini have ties
to a person or place nearby

If she did she chose not
to share it with her sisters

You were right theres
a cavity directly beneath us

 Atmosphere
 Its breathable

And Im getting a faint reading
from the dilithium tracker

down there as well

COMPUTER Warning Intruder alert

GRUNTING AND GROANING

GROANS

SHUDDERING BREATHS

Mom

JVini

JVINI I didnt want
more blood to be spilled

That can stop right now

Choose to live by leaving immediately

Come after me your lives are forfeit

Were totally gonna ignore
that warning arent we

Mmhmm

Lets move

TILLY QUIETLY Okay

ADIRA This isnt supposed
to be happening

I cant see him anymore

I cant feel him with me

The unjoining was a success

However I do not yet sense his presence

in the synthetic body

Hey Gray

GUARDIAN XI We must have patience

The process can take time

Please keep me apprised

Thank you

Um thisthis cant this cant be it

Were supposed to just sit here
andand do nothing

Well its like Guardian Xi said

It could take some time

Its him but its not

its not him and I dont really
know what to do with that

Lets go for a walk

Dr Pollard will be here

Grays monitors will alert us
to even the slightest change

Come on

SIGHS

TILLY Lost cause or lost civilization

This feels like a mausoleum

The degree of desiccation
suggests these pods

are several centuries old

Possibly older

Why would JVini bring
dilithium to a crypt

I have no idea

As your lieutenant suggested

maybe shes simply utilizing
this moon as a safe house

Hey check it out

Grave robbers

BURNHAM Yeah

But

why would a grave robber
bother doing this

JVinis cloak

Ive never seen a species like it

The database says unknown

Im gonna go out on a limb
and say that we found

her lost cause

Unlikely

If JVini had pledged her sword to it

her oath would have ended
with its demise

How are you so sure that
theres an oath here at all

I mean you believe that shes
operating from a place of honor

Her mercenaries just klled
one of her own sisters

Shed only draw against us
if she believed

we pose a threat to her cause

No Mom shes not above the law

The reasons matter

I thought youd understand that

Is that why you agreed
to a joint mission

Because you believe Id give her
the benefit of the doubt

TILLY Hey I just had a thought

CLEARS THROAT My mom and I
didnt really get along very well

She didnt really like children

um touching her or like
needing things from her

or actually generally being around her

Um but if she was here
right now I would just

I would give her the biggest hug

 RUMBLING
 Oh

 Seismic activity
 No

Controlled
matterandantimatter reactions

The dilithiums been activated

This isnt a moon Its a ship

And JVini just powered it up

Wheres the dilithium

TILLY Tracker says its

 right above our heads

There should be a way up there

GABRIELLE Fan out Search the chamber

Or we could just take the turbolift

CLICK

WHIRRING

STAMETS Given the nonlinear behavior

and topological structure of the DMA

it appears that any planet
within AU

of the ergosphere as Kwejian was

will sustain gravitational shearing

resulting in catastrophic instabilities

A primordial wormhole
accounts for this shear

but so far

Your theory and its challenges
are clear to us

Fantastic

Given time I would
work this out myself but

time is of the essence so here we are

Um uh ccould we discuss
the schedule for the day

Science first nap later

Uh I need all brains on deck here

Our scientists often work
in a deep meditative state

to sharpen their focus
and concentration

Oh well Ill um

wait over there then
in my own sharp state

Mr Booker

May I offer you a warm redspice

Many find it to be soothing
when experiencing

emotional distress

That obvious

Your grief is to be expected

But your body language
also expresses guilt

Illogical as the cause of
your loss was a force of nature

and as such not your fault

I wasnt aware Vulcans were
so emotionally attuned

A common misconception

Vulcans experience emotions
some quite strongly

We simply choose to suppress them

in favor of a more logical approach

CHUCKLES Care to give me
a few pointers on that approach

The discipline of the ariemnu
requires a lifetime to master

For the uninitiated respite
would be fleeting at best

A drowning man only needs one breath

I believe you require
a different set of tools

than I can offer Mr Booker

As a Kwejian

emotion is as essential
to you as air and blood

rendering the suppression
of guilt inadequate

What you require is freedom from guilt

There must have been
a sign it was coming

I missed it

If I hadnt I could
have saved my family

That is not illogical

TILLY It is a truly bizarre
reaction system

Uh the controls must be housed
somewhere else on the moon

Dilithium should be

Hmm

Bingo

Hello little tracker

Can you power the ship down from here

I think so but JVini
will definitely know

its been sabotaged

Just see what you can do

BURNHAM This shows a supernova

A moon leaving its world

Thats the ship were on

Their own planet became unlivable

And thats no mausoleum out there

BURNHAM GASPS Cryostasis

The species in the cocoons are alive

Now weve found her cause

Shes protecting them
from grave robbers

Got it

 WHIRRING CLACKING
 Great work

What now

Now

I need you to uh stay here

As bait

ADIRA It was a mistake

Should have never let Gray do it

Hed be here Hed be safe

The choice wasnt yours

Yeah but what if hes really gone

And please dont tell me hell
always be here in my heart

or my memories or whatever

Its not the same

 No its not
 SIGHS

But Ill tell you youre not alone

Were all here for you Adira

You may find that connecting
with someone

can be a guiding light
when things get dark

SARU I presume Gray remains in limbo

It could last indefinitely

I think the uncertainty might be
the hardest part for them

It is a challenging time for us all

Of late I am often reminded
of a Kelpien adage

It is difficult to ride two valebeasts

with only one set of buttocks

LAUGHING

Try riding three of them

You are doing a tremendous job Doctor

Uh with both jobs

Serving as medical officer and
ships counselor cannot be easy

Well thats why Im here to help

Or at least try

Sometimes the most important
thing we can do

is reach for one another

SIGHS

Its weird not feeling you

not even knowing where you are

I keep thinking youre just

all alone

Lost maybe

Um

Dr Culber said this thing about

connecting with people uh

being like a light in the dark




    

So

I figured maybe if you
cant find your way that

I could be the one to guide you

So Im here

reaching and

Ill be here until you come back

So

so please come back

 

Sit here and be bait

LAUGHS Im way outside
my comfort zone now

JVINI Move away from the engine

 Now
 I choose

I choose to live
 I choose to live

Absolutely

Michael

You should have left Gabrielle

Im here to help you

I just need to understand

 TILLY Captain
 GABRIELLE No Michael

Ive got this

Please You dont have to do this

BURNHAM JVini let her go

You get my warp drive back online

I know coming with us would mean
that you abandoned your cause

What if you dont have to abandon it

I know you dont want to kll her

And I think we can offer you a solution

You would say whatever you have
to to get me to drop my guard

BURNHAM No

No No lies I promise you

We have a few minutes

while Lieutenant Tilly
repairs the systems

Oh yeah At least
I mean ImIm hurrying

but II really did a number
on this thing so

BURNHAM The species
sleeping in the cocoons

theyre your lost cause arent they

You can trust her JVini
Shes my daughter

Theyre Abronians
the last of their kind

Their biomatter has high
concentrations of latinum

Its what the grave robbers wanted

And the Abronian who wears
your cloak was special to you

Taglonen

I didnt know him

That doesnt matter

Going as fast as I can

I was traveling through the star system

Suddenly I felt

love

community family

and suffering

It was as if someone
was calling out to me

begging me for help

The telepathic distress signal
was from Taglonen

There was no one else in range

 These people were under attack
 GRUNTING SWORDS CLANGING

I needed to protect the rest of them

I accepted his cause as my own

This was not the path I expected

but this is where Im needed

I promised that
as long as I was breathing

no further harm would come to them

The carvings on the wall suggest
the Abronians traveled here

while in cryosleep

and this planet that were orbiting

was meant to be their new home

And when they wake
I will make sure they claim it

 The dilithium was necessary
 Why

If they were supposed
to be here why move them

You know about the gravitational
anomaly near this sector

Yes we do

Without the dilithium
I wouldnt have been able

to move the Abronians to safety
if it had come this way

If you had asked we would
have given you the dilithium

I did ask

Starfleet doesnt dispense
dilithium to individuals

They would have wanted the name
and location of the species

JVini was representing

BURNHAM And you couldnt
risk the Abronians safety

by asking on their behalf
and revealing their existence

Killing your officer was never my plan

But his death was not in vain

I believe that the Abronians
were meant to wake

a long time ago

And theres no logical reason
why they would have remained

in cryostasis after their arrival

so I have to conclude that
there was some kind of failure

in the cryo system

So

if we fix the problem
and help them wake

wont your oath be fulfilled

You have until she finishes

Uh hi

Are you done

We are

Within the scope
of the data you provided

we are unable to identify any factors

to indicate the presence of tachyons

In the absence of such evidence

your hypothesis remains unproven

No

No This

has to be what it is

Lives are at stake

Your emotional response
to factual analysis

is quite illogical for a scientist

Perhaps proof may be
obtained another way

We do have a witness

Tachyons are superluminal

Upon hitting Kwejians atmosphere

they would have created
Cherenkov radiation

a glowing blue cast to the sky

Paul asked me the same
thing a million times

I dont remember a glow

Stored memories often hold more details

than an individual can access

A mind meld could uncover them

STAMETS No no

You cant ask him to

Hed have to relive all of it

What if shes right though

You shouldnt be retraumatized
because of my failure

Ill figure out the DMA another way

Thank you

But if this is how I can help

 I want to do it

 What do I do
 Just remember

My mind to your mind

DISTORTED ECHOING My thoughts

 to your thoughts
 Searched the entire force

 VOICES OVERLAPPING ECHOING
 Just do it Now

Come on back

THUDDING

TRINA I have what I need

BOOK No wait

Theres something else I need to see

CHITTERING CHIRPING

Look at them

Its like theyre still here

TRINA You understand you cannot alter the memory

You can only relive it

BOOK Theres this moment of Leto I keep seeing

The last moment I saw him

SPEAKS KWEJIAN

KYHEEM Im happy youre here

 

BOOK Thats it

I had turned to my brother but Leto looked back at me

Thats what I missed

He saw me

and he knew I loved him

SPEAKS KWEJIAN

LAUGHS

BOOK SPEAKS KWEJIAN

 

WHOOSHING

EXHALES

Thank you

Thank you

My condolences are

inadequate

STAMETS Are you all right

You look

Did you

find anything

There was no qualitative evidence

of superluminous radiation

Tachyons were not present

Im sorry you had to go
through that for nothing

It wasnt for nothing

I found the problem

GASPS

EXHALES

Theyll wake in a few minutes

Thats why you kept them safe

This path is at an end JVini

The next path awaits

Im sorry

CLANKING WHIRRING

TILLY I fixed the engine

That way if the anomaly comes this way

the Abronians can escape

Let me

I understand

SPEAKING ROMULAN IN UNISON

Hey

You may want to see this

 

Its the path theyre meant to be on

You gave them that

We gave them that

TILLY JVini said

she was unsure of her path
until she met Taglonen

And then you said that there
was another path ahead

The Qowat Milat are very big
on the path thing right

Well paths end and change
throughout everyones life

When we say choose to live

its an abbreviated form
of a longer saying

The path you are on has come to an end

Choose to live

If you find yourself at the wrong end

of a Qowat Milat sword
its pretty easy to see

that particular path is over for you

You either move on
to a new path and live

or you stay and die

What if the death is more metaphorical

In everyday life

a paths end can be harder to recognize

You must be willing
to look inside yourself

with absolute candor

Another thing youre very big on

Thank you for what you did today

You wondered why I agreed
to a joint mission

In truth it was because I was afraid

I might not be able to bring her in

And I knew youd make me

EXHALES Oh

Well you were right Mom

Reasons do matter

She kept an entire species
from extinction

It doesnt erase her crimes but

it does mean something

The details of JVinis
arrest are in her file

I would like to formally request
that mitigating circumstances

be taken into account
during her sentencing

Thank you Captain Burnham
for your service

Your request wont be necessary

Admiral Vance

President TRina

Starfleet remands the prisoner
JVini to your custody

for extradition to NiVar

Peace and long life

Jolan tru daughter

May you find peace with this

Tell me shell be held accountable

Its up to NiVar now

You gave me a mission

Which you executed admirably

Your role in this matter
has now concluded Captain

Admiral

Patrick Fickett

First officer of the Credence

He had a partner HaRyl

He had two kids

Krenn and Nael

I know

Then you know they deserve justice

I agree

I also know bringing NiVar
into the Federation

will benefit millions

Justice will be served Captain

In time

Youre really okay with this

Id have preferred a different outcome

But its hard to argue
with the president

trusting in NiVar
as we ask them to trust in us

Do you like music Captain

Sure

Think of us as um an orchestra

Youre first chair violin

with the showy challenging solos

Im the drum section

setting the pace providing backbone

Shes the conductor

When she signals us we play

Its not our job to know
if the cellist is drunk

or the woodwinds and brass are at war

We each have our part

and we must all trust that
she knows the symphony

That was a lot of analogy

Well they pay me by the letter

BURNHAM LAUGHS

 DOOR CHIMES
 Come

 CHITTERING CHIRPING
 Hello

Ah

I hear percussion

What are we listening to

It is the song of the Kaminar sea frog

I fell asleep to their
chirps as a child

and my recent stay rekindled
my love for their lullaby

Very beautiful

Is it strange to be back

It is

a work in progress

But I do my best each day
to find balance

You suggested to Michael
I go on todays mission right

I thought it might further your

quest for new experiences

I hope you found it helpful

I did Thank you

Can I try that

Certainly

This is the swampkelp bloom

It is

 So what happens if I touch it
 Uh

LAUGHS Im sorry

 RELIEVED SIGH
 Just kidding

Sorry

LAUGHS

BEEPING

INHALES

CHUCKLES

WHISPERS Oh my God

Are you okay

Are you you

Im definitely me

LAUGHS

 You okay
 Mmhmm

BOTH LAUGH

Guardian Xi is on his way

 Take it slow We dont know yet
 Thank you thank you

 thank you thank you
 ADIRA LAUGHS

I dont even know how to thank you

I had some words planned but

theythey dont even
come close and I

Its okay You dont
have to say anything

GRAY Guardian Xi

We are so grateful youre back

You get a hug as soon
as I see you in person

Whats it like

How do you feel

Im whole

and home

thanks to you

Wait did you

You heard me

I felt you

Reaching for me

Guiding me

I um I wasnt sure without
Tal linking us anymore

Well always be linked Adira

Always

CHIRPING CHITTERING

Kwejian forest

This was too painful a week ago

It was too painful this morning

Its still hard

But also

nice

What happened today

I got a memory back

And I realized

someday

if Im lucky the grief will fade

And if I dont want all my
other memories to fade with it

Ill have to open myself
back up to them

Good and bad

BURNHAM Your Ikhu Zhen amulet

Its been years since Ive worn it

It didnt feel right

Now it does

You seem peaceful

In this moment

yeah

Sometimes thats all we get

BURNHAM SIGHS
