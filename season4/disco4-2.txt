The new president of
the Federation, Laira Rillak.

I am T'Rina, President of Ni'Var.

CULBER: Gray?

We'll find a way to help you
be seen, truly seen.

By everyone.

You're thinking of Discovery again.

I am.

My heart is here, but yours
can be here and out there.

Nanosecond this is over,
I'm on the first ship home.

Commander Nalas, when's
the last time you went back?

Too long.

- Pull up Kwejian on the deep-space array.

BOOK: My ship was hit by something.

The gravitational distortion.

They're all gone.

I'm here.

Whatever you need.

BRYCE (OVER COMM): Captain, your guest is waiting for you

in the ready room.

I need some time, Bryce.

You should go.

No, I...

I need you to go.

Okay.

I'll check on you later.

(DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT)

BURNHAM: Saru.

You're here.

Captain.

Oh...

Thank you for coming so quickly.

It is an unspeakable tragedy.

Are there any survivors at all?

Right now, we only know of Book.

But the Federation's trying to locate

any Kwejian that may
have been off-world.

How is he?

He hasn't left his ship in two days.

Keeps obsessing over every detail.

Trying to find... I don't know...

evidence as to what may have caused it.

And I've been trying
to get him to talk...

or cry... anything.

He is in so much pain.

I don't know how to reach him.

Well, if loss has taught us anything,

it is that each of us must sit with pain

in our own way.

And you?

How are you doing?

I've been conducting
post-mission analyses

to figure out what I could have
done differently.

Lieutenant Aloka,
Ensign Neville, Commander Nalas.

Those losses are on me.

It sounds like you may
also be... obsessing.

Yeah. Maybe so.

That's beautiful.

It's the Kelpien symbol
for community, isn't it?

Ah. Community and service.

It signifies my status as
a council member in my village.

Must have been hard for you to leave.

Uh, I have made arrangements

to stay in touch with Su'Kal

and continue serving as
a council member in absentia.

Starfleet is where I am needed now.

Yes, I heard word that you were offered

the command of the USS Sojourner.

Congratulations.

I told Admiral Vance

I would gladly return
to the chair one day.

This is not that time.

Our mentor Philippa Georgiou

knew the value of
another set of trusted eyes,

especially in times of crisis.

I asked you to be those eyes
for me when I became captain.

Now it would be my honor...

and indeed my privilege...

to do the same for you,
as your Number One.

If you will have me.

I will take that, old friend.

Five light-years across.

That's the size
of the gravitational anomaly

that hit Kwejian and the space station.

Five light-years? That's massive.

We couldn't believe it
at first either, ma'am.

But we've been analyzing
this data for the past hours

and the math doesn't lie.

What exactly is this "anomaly"?

We're not certain.

We know it's there, we know it's moving,

but we can't quite get
a handle on what it is.

Our current theory is that
it's a roving binary black hole.

We believe the two black holes
are merging,

creating gravitational
waves in the process.

Huge ones.

Why was Kwejian destroyed
and the station wasn't?

Gravitational wave's impact
depends on where the object is

relative to the source.

The closer the object,
the greater the damage.

How did no one see it coming?

TILLY: Unless matter is actively
falling into a black hole,

they're largely undetectable.

STAMETS: We've been running simulations

to test our theory. They seem to mirror,

fairly accurately,

what happened to Kwejian.

(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)

Go on.

(SIGHS) Continue.

STAMETS: A planet couldn't possibly
withstand that kind of impact.

Are there records of anything
like this happening before?

We haven't found anything close

in any of the available databases.

Where's it headed next?

Current data is limited,

but our mathematical models have it

entering the Riscot system soon.

Let's begin evacuations right away.

And we should warn the areas
immediately surrounding it.

An anomaly this size could fling debris

far beyond five light-years.

Where's it going after that?
Where'd it even come from?

Do you have any indication
that it will stop?

To get answers, we need more data.

We have to get out there.

Scan this thing up close.

Once you have the data,

I offer the services of
the Ni'Var Science Institute.

We may not be Federation members,

but a crisis such as this
requires all to contribute.

Thank you, President T'Rina.

It would also be prudent

to prepare ourselves for civil unrest.

This news may reawaken post-Burn fears.

We are at a fragile time.

Openness and a unified
strategy will be critical.

RILLAK: Which is precisely
why you're all here.

Federation, non-Federation...

this anomaly threatens us all equally.

We must all work together.

Discovery will leave for
the anomaly immediately.

FEMALE (OVER COMM): All crew, report to stations, please.

All crew, report to stations.

- Yes, Lieutenant?
- Sorry.

Sorry, just, um... I was...

Ugh, sorry. I'm just... keep
making it more and more weird.

I'm just gonna say it. You...

Did you get taller?

Not that I'm aware of.

Oh. Oh, okay.

I d... I don't know if
Kelpiens grow later in life,

or... but...

You just... you do, you seem taller.

Do I?

Yeah.

I don't know, maybe you just, like,

have a little more swagger
going on or something.

That's a compliment.

Then I thank you.

I'm really glad you're back.

SARU: I missed you, too.

And I am very sorry

for what you went through
on the space station.

Thank you.

FEMALE (OVER COMM): Security briefing on Deck Seven in five minutes.

When I think about... Nalas

and, uh, Kwejian, all those people...

Hell, life is just a blink, huh?

It's... it is one heartbeat

in the entire lifespan of the universe.

Just don't really think
I understood that before.

How we choose to spend our moments

in the short time that we have...

matters.

Welcome back, Captain.

Thank you.

But please call me Saru.

How about Mr. Saru?

Well, that would be...

acceptable.

Commander Bryce,
open a ship-wide channel.

Aye, Captain.

Ready.

Discovery.

Today we seek to understand a threat

like none our galaxy has faced before.

We know the cost of its destructive power all too well.

We lost colleagues, friends...

and Kwejian.

Countless lives...

histories... futures.

We won't let their deaths be in vain.

And we are going to make damn sure

nothing like this happens again.

Not on our watch.

(ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS)

Tilly, get Commander Stamets up here.

Detmer, how are we doing?

Safely in the green zone, Captain.

Matching the anomaly's speed
to maintain relative distance.

Any strain on the ship?

Subspace gravitational
waves are present,

but not the patterns we expected.

It's very odd.

BURNHAM: That's not the only thing.

"Binary black hole" means

we should be seeing two of them.

STAMETS: Curiouser and curiouser.

Scientific observation, please?

Apologies, Captain.

It's just not what I was
expecting to see, either.

There's an accretion cloud
made of both gas and dust,

and large amounts of dark matter
surrounding a gravity well,

so a black hole makes sense, but...

But the gravitational Doppler shift

from our scans is way off.

- Meaning?
- Meaning,

I have no idea what we're looking at.

It's... bizarre.

And that is a scientific observation.

What else are our scans telling us?

Not much. Scans can't penetrate

the outer edge of the accretion cloud.

Can we boost power to the scanners?

Already tried. The scans aren't
viable unless we get closer.

BURNHAM: How close?

Past the outer edge of dust
and into the accretion cloud?

That's in the yellow zone, Captain.

Discovery would be at serious risk.

We have to know what we're dealing with.

Mr. Saru?

We could send DOTs
with sensors attached,

but the gravitational distortions

would make it very difficult
to communicate with them.

They're also way too small.

Not enough mass to penetrate the dust.

My ship can do it.

Enough mass to get in,

not so much that I'll be in trouble.

Plus, my ship can change shape

to compensate for the torque.

As long as I'm not inside too long...

The science holds.

Commander Detmer, get ready.
Commander Stamets,

I want you with her
to conduct the scans.

BOOK: Captain.

Can we talk?

Detmer doesn't know the first thing

- about how to morph my ship.
- Whoever goes in there

- has to be clear-headed.
- And I'm not?

How could you be, after
everything that's happened?

- That's for me to judge.
- And me.

- As captain of this ship.
- Pretend for one second

you're in my place.

Come on, Michael, you'd fight like hell

to go on this mission.

And Hugh would say no.

- Michael...
- And he would be right.

- That thing destroyed my home.
- I know. And I know you want

- to do something.
- I'm the best pilot for this mission

- and you know it.
- Listen, I know you want

to do something,
but it's not as simple as that.

I don't need your permission.

I'm not Starfleet.

Technically, I'm not even
under your command.

If you go out there
and you're not ready...

... you endanger everyone on this ship.

Come on. Look, I know you don't
want to put more lives at risk.

Getting this data, and doing
it right the first time,

is our best chance to save lives.

We can warn other worlds,
give them time to evacuate.

I'm going, Michael.

I'm flying straight at that thing.

If you want to stop me,
you can throw me in the brig

or you can shoot me out of the sky.

But I'm going.

It's everything I'd imagined.
(SOFT CHUCKLE)

I can't believe I get
to start my life again.

I could become a host again.

Finish my training to be a Guardian.

- I-I could...
- ADIRA: Anything.

I mean, you can do anything.

Yeah.

But...

with everything that's happened...

Is there something
not right with the body?

He's feeling guilty

about being happy right now.

You know?

Life goes on, Gray. It has to.

For all of us.

But the artisan did
a beautiful job with the body.

She used the Soong Method,

named after the th century
cyberneticist who developed it.

This is -year-old technology?

Maybe I should get
a synth body when I die, too.

We could live forever.

Well, not likely.

But the process was attempted
a number of times

after Dr. Soong first used it
on a... a Starfleet admiral...

Picard was his name...

but the success rate was so low

that eventually people
just stopped trying.

What... Should we be worried?

Well, the fact that Gray's consciousness

has already survived transfer
to a new host once

seems to be a good sign.

But we should ask Guardian Xi

once the synthetic body's ready.

When I incorporate,

will the body age and die?

Like I would have before?

Uh, he's asking if
this body will get old.

You know, like, gray hair,

the long, scraggly nose hairs,

the pot belly and all.

So not what I said.

It will age in the same way.

For better or for worse.

GRAY: Can we get rid of the mole?

I thought you stopped hating that.

I just asked, because...

transitioning, it's like I had
bigger things to think about,

but if I get another chance

to remake my body, then...

why not get rid of all the things

that aren't totally "me", you know?

He wants to lose the mole.

Oh. Well, that's why we're here,

to make last-minute adjustments.

(ADIRA CHUCKLES)

(TRILLING)

(DOOR CHIMES)

Come.

Oh. You added a holo.

(BIRD SQUAWKS)

Is this Ni'Var?

Cliffs of Surak.

That's Lake Yuron.

It looks the same
as it did when I was a child,

when this was Vulcan.

I used to run away...

I used to run away here.

When I was getting used
to my parents being gone.

Uh, you wished to speak
with me about Mr. Booker?

Take me home, Zora.

ZORA: Yes, Captain.

The computer's now Zora?

Picked the name herself.

- Oh.
- (BURNHAM CHUCKLES)

Please.

Book plans to fly to the anomaly

with or without my permission.

Well, that would
certainly be deleterious

to your relationship.

The captain in me knows

that he's the right choice
for the mission.

He knows it, too.

But...

I've seen him...

not sleeping, not eating...

Mr. Booker's expertise with his ship

does make him supremely well
suited for this particular task.

More so than Commander Detmer,

despite her considerable skills.

His planet was destroyed.

Well, billions more lives
will be at risk

until we understand the anomaly

well enough to predict its path.

So you think I should let him go.

As do you, I believe.

Yeah, but your personal feelings
complicate your decision.

What if he takes unnecessary risks?

I wonder, then, if added safety measures

would be helpful to all involved.

I have some ideas,
if that would be helpful.

Have I mentioned I am glad you're back?

I believe you have.

You want to send the only two people

who can operate
the spore drive, together,

into the accretion cloud

of an unknown astrophysical entity?

You might as well
blow me out an airlock.

Oh.

Too soon? Probably too soon.

But still, it's madness.

Yes, which is why
you'll be going as a holo.

Oh. Well, in that case...

Your body will be right here
on Discovery the entire time.

The anomaly creates
enormous distortions.

We might not be able
to maintain a holo signal.

Right, which is why
we'll be using a tether

to help Book's ship maintain
proximity to Discovery.

And, if we have to,
we will use it to pull him out.

And I want you on the bridge,
listening in on comms.

Let me know if you have
any reason for concern.

Yes, Captain.

"Blow me out an airlock"?

It was humor.

Neural link.

You'll feel everything on Book's ship

as if you were really there.

If, for whatever reason,
you remove this transmitter,

you'll be right back here...
What's wrong?

I wouldn't know what to say
to Book on a good day.

Well, when you lost me, what did
you want people to say to you?

It's not nearly the same thing.

Grief is grief.

And everyone moves
through it differently.

Let Book guide you.

Are you sure?

Things have been
seriously awkward with him

since he jumped Discovery
to the dilithium planet.

Just trust your instincts.

You should know better
than to say that to me.

You're better than you think you are.

Uh, sorry, I'm...

I-I thought I'd be able
to tell the difference, but...

So, um, I've been meaning to ask you.

When-when you're using
the spore drive interface,

do you ever feel...
cramps in your hands?

Or, uh, tingles in your arms?

No?

Okay...

Hey, girl.

Look, uh, I get it.

We're not friends. (CHUCKLES)

But... I know you've been through a lot.

So, uh...

if there's anything
I can do to help out or...

Maybe stop talking.

That'd be a good start.

Excuse me?

I don't need a tether

and I sure as hell don't need a minder.

I'm here for the data.

You wouldn't know what to look for.

Fine.

Open your eyes.

Now.

(EXHALES)

Any sign?

OWOSEKUN: Not yet.

(SIGHS)

BOOK: I'm free. I'm clear.

Transmitting scan data now.

It's time to come home.

And well done, Commander Bryce.

May we all cultivate
such life-saving hobbies.

Thank you, Mr. Saru.

(CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

- Nice work, you.
- Oh.

Really good work.

Thanks.

BOOK: Cut it close there, for sure.

Well, this... data
should be a gold mine.

Oh, don't look at me.

That was all you.
I just drove this thing.

Thank you.

For saving my family.

I'm going to figure
this thing out. For you.

Whatever it takes.

I promise.

You know...

I do get arm tingles in the spore drive.

Yeah.

Weirdest thing.

(CHUCKLES)

I'm going to take this off now.

CULBER: Welcome back.

MALE (OVER COMMS): Lieutenant Callahan,

- please report to Engineering.
- Oh. Hey.

Hi, sorry.

Um, I just wanted to thank you,

uh, for your advice, um, with Adira.

It can be hard for them

to let others see past
how bright they are.

Yeah.

You have a very,
uh, light touch with people.

I really admire that.

You do, too.

Usually.

Yeah. I think, um, you were right

about me feeling pressure.

Um, not about the station, but...

I mean, don't get me wrong,
that was just...

unbelievably shitty.

- But, um...
- But this is something... bigger?

Yeah, like...

Things just don't f... feel
the same way that they used to.

Like...

I don't know, something's off. Or, um...

I'm off.

Uh...

I don't know, I was kind of hoping that

we could talk about it sometime.

Like, talk-talk.

Like, uh... professionally?

Of course.

And whatever it is,
we'll figure it out together.

Hmm?

Thanks.

Okay. (LAUGHS) That wasn't so hard.

- Whew.
- Just... little awkward.

Not... But not hard.

- You did good.
- Thank you.

I'm gonna go dig into that data.

- All right.
- All right.

- Go save the world.
- Oh, I will.

(EXHALES)

- You were kind of a...
- Oh, my God.

... big deal today, you know that?

Your algorithms are...

mathematical works of art.

Thank you. (LAUGHS)

I guess I, um... made waves.

Okay, no.

(BOTH LAUGH)

What is it?

You-you got to see your body today.

Which is huge

and I'm-I'm so happy

that you get to incorporate soon.

I hear a "but"...

(LAUGHING): No.

It's okay.

You can tell me.

Nalas...

everything that, uh, happened,

you know, the suddenness of it,

and just the whole awful thing,

um, reminded me of what happened to you.

It's just been on my mind.

(LAUGHS) I...

I didn't want to bring it up
on such a joyful day,

so I'm-I'm really sorry.

I don't even know how to begin
to talk about this.

You just did.

You're really good at this, you know?

The... the being there for people.

You always have been, so...

Everyone's got to have their thing.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

Yeah.

And you're gonna make
a great Guardian someday.

Hey.

Hey.

Hell of a day.

(SCOFFS)

Brilliant flying.

You were right.

I wasn't ready.

But you did it.

And you trusted me.

Thank you for that.

I keep seeing him.

Leto.

I don't know if he knew...

if I ever let him know
how much I loved him.

You know, for so many years,

I told myself I didn't need family.

Didn't need Kwejian.

But then I found my brother again...

the nephew I didn't even know I had...

And when I looked at Leto...

I saw a new beginning.

For all of us.

We could give him a future

where there was a home...

and family...

and love.

And nothing he couldn't do.

I'm sorry.

They're gone, Michael. (SNIFFLES)

(CRYING)

Mr. Saru.

Lieutenant.

Has the data from Mr. Booker's ship

shed new light on
the nature of this threat?

Not yet. We still have an
Everest-sized mountain of data

to analyze.

Oh, uh...

Earth mountain. It's very big.

Doesn't matter. Point being,
I did find something.

The reason the distortions got worse,

even though Discovery held its position?

So this is the anomaly when we arrived.

And this is it after we left.

It changed direction?

What could have caused that?

That's the thing:

there is nothing in
my understanding of astrophysics

that can explain it.

But... we gathered this data

in order to predict its path.

Are you saying we cannot do that?

No, sir, we can't.

It could go anywhere,
at any time, and...

we may not have
any kind of warning at all.
