Youre losing sight of the real problem

The Anomaly I took what I learned

about the device at
the center of the DMA

and designed this a weapon
capable of destroying it

If we detonate this weapon

we cannot control the
message were sending

If we make first contact peacefully

carefully we can

And I understand the
appeal of Tarkas plan

But communication and diplomacy
this is why the Federation

has lasted for so long

Itll save more lives in the long run

All we know for sure is that
the DMA will keep killing

if we do nothing

Power source that controls that device

I need it to go home

Book no

In order to build an isolytic weapon

Tarka needs isolynium

Thats a blackmarket element

that is not easy to track down

I planted a tracker

The signal can be detected
from multiple sectors away

VANCE If the DMA is
their mining equipment

I can only imagine what
their weapons are like

And if their power supply is threatened

it will almost certainly
be seen as a hostile act

Booker and Tarka must be stopped

I know

BOOK Not as much isolynium
in here as I thought

Wil it be enough

TARKA Federation banned
it for good reason

A little goes a long way

BOOK Is it enough to destroy the DMA

TARKA And then some

Careful

Careful

And we have ourselves a weapon

How long till its ready

Five or six hours

I need to calibrate
to destroy the DMA controller

but protect the internal power source

As long as I can generate
a nullspace bubble

within the isolytic detonation field

the power source should be fine

Just speed it up

Shell understand once this is over

They all will

Were not gonna lose
anyone else to that thing

DOOR CHIMES

Come

 Captain
 Finally got a response from Book

Its encrypted so it cant be traced

I thought you should see it

Michael

Hey

I went through all the data you sent

Makes sense the DMA could be
some kind of mining device

and all thats happened
is collateral damage

But even if this is true

it doesnt change how many lives
have been lost

How many more will be lost if
we dont do something right now

The DMA could move again at any time

We just cant afford to wait

I love you Michael

I wish there was a way to find
a middle ground on this but

I just dont see it

Im sorry

Goodbye

SARU Well

I really thought it
would make a difference

if he knew it wasnt an attack

Now if we dont stop them
that could be what comes next

It would seem he has
left us with no choice

VANCE To say that this wasnt easy

would be an insult to understatement

The optics the complexities

BURNHAM Sir

am I able to lead this mission or not

Are you sure that thats what you want

It is

Well President Rillak had
quite a lot to say about this

But she does understand
that Discovery is the only ship

capable of reaching Mr Booker on time

and no one knows him better than you

I also reminded her
that you have never let me down

Thank you sir

Dont thank me yet

The president remains concerned

that if things dont go smoothly

you might be too emotionally compromised

to make the hard call

I have the same concern
so Im going to send

another officer with you

Someone who will be empowered
to step in if needed

and issue the necessary orders

with the full backing of my authority

With respect Admiral

thatthat is Captain Sarus job

He too is close to Book is he not

EXHALES

I understand this is awkward Captain

May I ask who the officer is

A friendly face

which I hope will make
it easier on everyone

Commander will you please join us

DOORS WHOOSH OPEN

Captain

Commander Nhan

LAUGHS SOFTLY

 Its good to see you
 You too

BURNHAM Uh sir II have to say

if the concern is my connection to Book

Nhan and I go way back

Im aware But shes also a Barzan

And theres a reason
so many of her world

serve in the security forces

Duty above all

Ill give you two a minute

NHAN I uh

Id only met Book in passing

but he sounds like a good man

Im sorry its come to this

Thank you for that Nhan

So when did you join
Federation Security

I thought you were
still living on Barzan

I was but after completing
the seedvault mission

I ended up not staying too long

Hmm

Upgraded my breathers though

 Real eyes real you
 Mmhmm

Were you able to find your family line

and connect with them

Uh yeah

Didnt work out

And Security asked me
to lead a cleanup task force

against the Emerald Chain

Covert ops I couldnt tell anyone

I read the reports

Bloody skirmishes in the outer sectors

This isnt the way I
wanted to come back

But I figured better me
than someone you dont know

Im glad its you

Mr Saru

I hope Im not disturbing you

Not at all It is always
a pleasure to hear from you

Well I wonder if I may ask a favor

On NiVar I joined you in
a threshtor kashek meditation

I found it greatly helpful
in settling my mind

I could use such help now

Of course

Your hands

Breathe deeply

You are having difficulty focusing

SARU SIGHS

I am distracted yes

The mission to stop Mr Booker

will be a most unfortunate
undertaking

Indeed it will

But I sense that is not all

You are insightful as ever

My ward SuKal

He is deeply worried about the Anomaly

I do not know how to comfort him

Ah of course at such a dire time

these personal feelings
are of little import

Such feelings are always of import

May I suggest

when formal meditation
proves challenging

I find the peaceful
routines of daily life

and the joyful connection therein

can help reestablish inner balance

A walk perhaps or aa shared
meal between friends

I would be pleased to join you
if youd like

I w I will uh consider that

Thank you Madam President

Of course

Good luck Mr Saru

EXHALES

The captain is on her way
Let us prepare for departure

I cant believe were
actually doing this

Book hasnt exactly given us
much of an option

He thinks hes doing the right
thing A lot of people agree

SARU Whatever ones opinions

we all have our orders

Hey look whos back

LAUGHS

Youre Federation Security now

 Damn
 NILSSON You look great

Its so good to see you

This is a wonderful surprise Commander

Thank you sir Ive
really missed all of you

And feel free to ignore me
Im just observing

Seeing how the pros do it

No they should know

Commander Nhan is here because
of my personal connection

to this mission

We need to stop Book and Tarka
and shes going to help

make sure the job is done right

I would have made
the same choice

if I were
in the admirals shoes

EXHALES This isnt an easy mission

Not for any of us

But it is critical that we succeed

Commander Owosekun on screen

The tracker in Books ship
tells us that theyre here

hiding in this uninhabited rogue planet

We believe theyre
finishing construction

on the isolytic weapon

Well have the element of surprise

We need to use it well
If they manage to jump

into the DMA before we detain them

pursuit will become much more dangerous

Black alert

Activate cloak

Lets fly

 

 

 

ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS

BURNHAM Status report

DETMER Books ship is inside
a cavity  meters in

RHYS No sensors or security
around the outside perimeter

BURNHAM Okay

Lets get into position

Take us as close as you can Commander

Aye Captain Coming in

Stopping in three two

 one

Were ready

RHYS Bringing Books
ship on screen Captain

BURNHAM Mr Saru Commander
Nhan in my ready room

Have Dr Culber join

Books ship has a builtin
security disruption field

so we cant beam directly on board

but a cloaked shuttle can slip in

close to this maintenance hatch

Thatll be our entry point

Respectfully Im not sure you
should be leading this mission

I wasnt planning to
Mr Saru will be taking point

Dr Culber will be joining
with Commander Rhys

 and Commander Bryce will pilot
 What about

Bryces work for Dr Kovich

We still need to make first contact

Ill have Zora keep looking
for communication frequencies

that can pass through
the Galactic Barrier

Then Commander Bryce will
have plenty to analyze

when he gets back from the mission

 Mr Saru please take her through it
 Of course Captain

We will use a multiphasic
signal discriminator to override

external proximity sensors
and gain entrance

before Mr Booker and Tarka
are notified of our arrival

Once we make our way to the bridge

Dr Culber will help deescalate

the situation so we may take the ship

Book is acting out of anger and grief

Hes doing what he thinks is right

but hes not unreasonable

Tarkas the wild card here

We will have our phasers
with us but set to stun

Only to be used if necessity requires

I know youll make the right call

Be safe

BRYCE  meters and closing

RHYS Book will be locked up for life

He stole classified tech

Hes about to use an isolytic weapon

Because the Federation
isnt acting fast enough

You dont know what its like
to lose everything

What do you want us to do
launch an attack

RHYS Im not saying we
should attack But

BRYCE Stop comparing pain man

 You have no idea
 Gentlemen

you are here to execute your orders

however you may feel about them
or one another in this moment

Listen this is tough for everyone

And we all have different views
on what Books done

but were here to fix this

and thats what were gonna do

Together Okay

Thank you Dr Culber

Prepare the shuttle
for docking Commander Rhys

Commander Bryce take us in

 Aye Mr Saru
 Aye Mr Saru

SHUTTLE COMPUTER Protective
shielding deployed

BRYCE Were now at full stop

two meters from the maintenance hatch

Engaging airlock field

Commander Owosekun isolate the
shuttles cloaking signature

Aye Captain

The shuttles soft dock
is complete Captain

No response from Bookers
proximity sensors

They dont seem to know were here

Proceed Mr Saru

SARU Commander Rhys prepare
the signal discriminator

Are you good

ALARM BLARING

Captain somethings not right

 SOFT SKITTERING SOUND
 BURNHAM Disco Two report

Saru

Something is on the shuttle Captain

ALARM BLARING

Like all over the shuttle

ALARM SOUNDING

Ive never heard an alarm
like this on my ship

Its our new defense system

Its just a little
something I threw together

on our way to Porathia

Without telling me

We were buying banned weapons tech

from an underworld market

Its an intrusion warning

Its one of Discoverys shuttles

Michael mustve slipped
a tracker on the isolynium

Did you know his ship could do that

No Commander Owosekun
can you beam them back

I cant Too much interference
from the disruption field

 Im losing comms Captain
 Saru you need to abort

SARU Understood Captain

Commander Bryce get
us back to Discovery

Im trying sir

You need to stop it Theyll be klled

I designed the system to be autonomous

Theyll be dead before I can

even reprogram the first layer

Come on Weve got to do something

Were stuck II cant disengage

LOUD THUDDING

SHUTTLE COMPUTER Structural
integrity compromised

Fire an EMP charge through the hull

Might slow it down enough
for the shuttle to break free

Got it

Owosekun how much
time do they have left

Hull integrity down to ten percent

CULBER Oxygen levels
are dropping Captain

Discovery shuttle ready thrusters

 to blast yourselves free
 Book

Captain theres a
massive electromagnetic

surge coming from Books ship

Saru maximum thrusters

 Now
 Go Mr Bryce

SHUTTLE COMPUTER Hull breach imminent

 BURNHAM Saru
 We are trying Captain

Come on Get out of there

Can you get a lock now

Im working on it Captain

DETMER The shuttles breaking apart

 BURNHAM Owosekun
 Almost got them

GRUNTING

PANTING

GASPS

Is everyone all right

SARU We are indeed

Thank you all for your assistance

Okay lets get back to stations

Commander Bryce let me know
what you find with Dr Kovich

Aye Captain

Captain we just lost
the tracker signal

Its probably because
they found it Hail him

BOOK Did everyone make it off in time

 Yes Book listen
 Im sorry Michael

I have a job to do

OWOSEKUN They jumped Captain

 Hes gone
 Damn it

Theyre going to the DMA

Then so are we

We cannot allow them
to destroy that controller

We cannot let our first contact
with Species TenC

be an act of aggression

Not if we want peace

We have no idea where the controller is

We dont know what exactly
well find when we jump in

so lets be prepared for anything

Black alert

ALERT BLARING

 

 ALARM BLARING
 Shields up

And lets find that
controller before they do

If we beat them to it what then

How do you plan on stopping them
from using their weapon

Figuring that out is next on my list

LINUS Captain dark matter interference

is greater than expected

Cloaking will be spotty at best

Its impacting shield stability

Scanning range is limited as well

Its like finding a
needle in a haystack

as my grandma used to say

Mr Booker will be facing
similar challenges

Yes but he has a head start

Detmer plot a grid search pattern

 Aye Captain
 BURNHAM Owosekun

scan for the subspace rift
around the DMA controller

Given its size it should be easier

to find than the device itself

Aye Captain

Captain Mr Saru

I need to request that
we speak privately

Commander Nilsson you have the conn

My orders were to let you carry
out this tactical operation

without intervening

If it failed I was to
give you this briefing

Theres a vulnerability thatll
allow us to disable Books ship

before they can fire their weapon

I know Books ship Its airtight

Not with the prototype
spore drive it isnt

If we fire a photon torpedo
at the impulse manifold

the detonation will
cause a chain reaction

hit a weak spot in the drive

and destroy the whole thing

With all the interference here

we wouldnt be able to beam them out

Which is why its a last resort

If the explsin sets
off the isolytic weapon

it could destroy
Discovery in the process

Not if we can jump away first

If

Billions of lives will
be saved either way

Look Im sorry about Book

and I know the options
arent pleasant

It isnt just about Book or Discovery

The Federation needs that spore drive

We have to at least consider this

Theres too much at stake
If theres any other way

And if you wait too long
to realize there isnt

That wont happen And
I will not let you

Im authorized

to relieve you of command
and issue the order

I will not let you take over my ship

 while I safely weigh
 Please Please

If I may

Dr Culber offered
some sage advice earlier

That in times of division

we identify that upon
which we can agree

A shared goal perhaps
that can lead to compromise

Youre right

We need to find middle ground

between us and with Book

A shared goal

Engineering

Stamets

Im working fast as I can
to increase the scanning range

Put Reno on it
I need you for something else

Check my logic here

If you needed something

you wouldnt stop until
you got it right

Or at least until you had no choice

but to move on and look
somewhere else for it

I have no idea
what youre talking about

Boronite

Thats what the DMA is mining

and they wouldnt leave an area

until the boronite in
that area was exhausted

So if we scan

for the remaining boronite
in this subsector

We can calculate the rate of consumption

and predict how much longer
before the DMA jumps again

Exactly

Ah but the uh margin of error

I dont have a large enough sample size

Work with Zora to build a model
based on what weve got

If we can get a timetable
we might be able

to use it to get Book to stand down

STAMETS On it

We should call the admiral

Lets do it together

 Any sign of the controller
 BOOK Not yet

And with all the interference

our cloak keeps going in and out

Listen About the shuttle

They almost died

Im sorry

This mission is ten years
in the making for me

I need this to work

And I understand very well
what all this means to you

With Discovery in the way

there will come a point

when you have to decide
whats more important

Your feelings for them
or stopping the DMA

Dont go behind my back again

 Finish the weapon
 It is finished

I asked you five minutes
ago where to load it

and you were too distracted to hear me

Torpedo Tube Six

Ill continue scanning
for the controller

CHIMING

Sensors are picking up an energy spike

Is it the controller

II cant tell

Its an object of some kind

Bookers ship dead ahead

Ten degrees hard to port

Aye Captain

I knew you were out here somewhere

We have a shot We could take it

Or we could burn out Books scanners

make it impossible for them
to find the controller

Rhys launch a full spread
of sensorblinding bursts

at Books ship as we pass

 maximum energy yield
 Aye Captain

Where did they come from

Shes trying to blind our scanners

Well done them

Scanner functions down to 

 Can you fix it
 Yes but not if they hit us again

They wont See the
hydrogen cloud ahead

Were gonna give them a taste
of their own medicine

Book just fired something
in the direction

of that hydrogen cloud

A magnesium charge

Hes going to ignite it in seconds

 How do you know that
 We had a runin with pirates

in Breen space back in the day
He pulled the same move

Detmer take us toward it

Captain with compromised shields

the heat blast will burn out
our thermal regulators

We will avoid the blast
if we dive in low

and thatll blind Book long enough

for us to get out of here

Detmer on my mark full power astern

adjust course  mark 

 DETMER Aye Captain
 BURNHAM Here comes the blast

Now

Take us into that dark
matter dust cloud

degrees off our starboard beam

Once were in resume the grid search

Aye Captain

That was an act of aggression

He knew whatever damage
would be temporary

Were not out of options yet

TARKA Whered they go

The Breen gambit

 Shes got a good memory
 What does that mean

And why the hell are you laughing

Theres nothing funny about this

We dont know where they went

Im guessing somewhere
in that dark matter cloud

This isnt a game Book
Youre costing us time

No Im saving our asses
The only thing weve got going

is that I know Michaels
tactics and I know her crew

Yeah maybe you know them too
well Maybe thats the problem

Just fix the damn scanner

so we can find the
controller before they do

Captain Im getting
strong sensor contact

High concentration
of galactic barrier particles

 Its the subspace rift
 Great work Owosekun

Detmer set a course
Stamets where are we

with that boronite timetable

Were working as fast as we can

Were crunching gigaquads of raw data

Can you crunch faster

Is there an acceptable
answer other than yes

 No
 Then yes

DETMER Thats it Captain

The DMA controller

BURNHAM Give us a closer look

NILSSON The TenC dont care do they




    

Churn space take boronite

Rinse and repeat

We will stop them
and well do it the right way

Wont be long before
Books here to try his way

And well be ready

Commander Detmer bring us in
as close as possible

I want to put ourselves between
Books ship and that controller

And we are going to hold
as long as we possibly can

Stamets I need that timetable

STAMETS Working on it with Zora

Just need a little bit longer

We cant keep playing
cat and mouse forever

Once they get here well need to make

a decisive move or they will

We just need
to stall long enough for Stamets

to get the data I need
to talk Book down

Getting new data didnt
change his mind before

Why would it now

Because hes reasonable

and hes logical

and he really doesnt want
to see anyone hurt

I know hell give us more time
I know he will

Well just need to know how much

And what if youre wrong

Then we can find another way

We already have another way

We need to be ready

Commander Rhys

This tactical program

it would destroy Books ship

BURNHAM Were not there yet

Thats a last resort

We hope to avoid this option
for everyones sake

But my orders are
to prevent them from firing

on that controller at any cost

OWOSEKUN Sensors are
picking up Bookers ship

Hes coming in fast

Okay hell have to decloak

to get a target lock

Maintain our cloaking
as best as you can

Drop it on my mark

Aye Captain

BURNHAM Stamets let Zora take over

I need you to jump

TARKA Its genius The controller

This is going to work

What were doing is
really going to work

Is the weapon loaded

TARKA On your mark

 ALARM SOUNDING
 SHIP COMPUTER Warning

Proximity alert

Damn it They found us
and theyre blocking our shot

Can you beam it in

Ill have to lower the disruption field

 Theyd be able to beam us out
 Well go around them

Jump

BURNHAM Stamets get
ready to jump again

Detmer stay between him
and that controller

 Do not let them get a clean shot
 DETMER Aye Captain

You had a shot at the controller

You should have taken it

We have one weapon
We cant afford to miss

Im gonna warn them off
Target their shields

Shields down to  Captain

 NHAN Captain
 Hes not trying to hurt us

just warn us off

We can argue semantics
all we want but I think

we can both agree
that Book is shting at us

RUMBLING

 Rhys return fire
 Aye Captain

So how long are you planning
on letting them hit us

Shes doing the same thing
we are warning us off

Look I know you love her

I know you care for her crew
but this needs to stop

You want to go to some home
in another universe

I lost my entire home here

Dont you dare tell me how to do this

Im firing another
round of warning shots

then we jump again Get ready

TARKA Damn it Enough

No

That was a full spread
of quantum torpedoes

Shields down to 

Give the order or I will Captain

There is no way Book was
responsible for that attack

It doesnt matter I lost half
my team on my last mission

waiting too long to make a call
I knew needed to be made

I will not let that happen again

You said it yourself
The stakes are too high

Its time

I fear she may be right

SOUNDS FADE

BURNHAMS BREATHING ECHOES

STAMETS Captain weve
finished our calculations

It should take hours
About a full week

Before the DMA gets
all the boronite in this area

and jumps again

BURNHAM Great work

Lieutenant Christopher
hail Books ship

No response Captain

Keep trying Commander Rhys

I want you to obey the order

if Commander Nhan gives it

Mr Saru you have the conn

Commander Nhan with me

With your team
how many lives did you save

 I dont understand
 How many



Not too long ago I made
a choice that saved lives too

In the process I lost others

As leaders we see success
or failure right or wrong

but its never that binary Nothing is

There is a middle ground here

And I know that I can
get Book to see it

I just have to make him look

What can you do put on an EV suit

and pound on his viewscreen

I was thinking more fly a shuttle

in front of his viewscreen

If they try to launch
their weapon we will fire

You wont survive

I believe in Book

But if Im wrong if anything happens

I know youll save my team

Your team

Good luck Michael

SARU We are standing by Captain

Commander Rhys is locked on target

BURNHAM Understood

Touch the console again
and Ill take your hands off

We came here to put a stop to the DMA

COMPUTER CHIMES

Shuttle identify yourself

BURNHAM Book its me

Michael

Commander Rhys stand by

Aye Commander

BURNHAM You havent
been answering our hails

BOOK Been a little busy

Impressive maneuvering by the way

BURNHAM You too

Book we cant go on like this

If we keep digging in
on our own sides

well keep battling each other
and not the real threat

I know you get that

You said you wished
there was a middle ground

I do

Im sending you new data

Now given the rate
the DMA is mining boronite

we expect it to remain
in this uninhabited area

of space for another week

No lives will be in
danger during that time

And what Im about to propose
is a plan President Rillak

and Admiral Vance both approved

You stand down for the week

you come aboard Discovery

 we hold you there
 Hold us

Not in the brig

Just there for safetys sake
and its just one week

And the Federation uses
that time to make first contact

and work to convince
whoever created this thing

to withdraw it

And if that fails

theyll back your plan
to destroy the controller

SHIP COMPUTER Privacy
settings activated

We cant take this deal

You lost voting rights
when you fired those torpedoes

We both have so much at stake here

You cant just decide to

Its a viable compromise

Or its a lie

She would say anything
to get you to back off

I trust Michael Completely

And its the right choice

I need that power source
I need to go home

Book

Dont do this Please

Well stand down for a week

BURNHAM Thank you

Discovery

Im on my way back

Cancel black alert

Book and Tarka are standing down

Prepare for them in shuttle bay

EXHALES

Are you familiar with
the concept expected utility

Its a core tenet of game theory

A mathematical method to help
determine the optimal move

in a situation where risk is high

and the outcome is unclear

Such analysis can lead
to unexpected solutions

Of course one needs
to be clearheaded

to make the right move

What are you doing

 Im being clearheaded
 No

 SIGHS
 OWOSEKUN Captain

they lowered the disruption field

Im reading a transporter signature

And a massive tachyon surge
inside the DMA controller

BOOK Michael Tarka beamed
the weapon into the controller

Itll go off any second
You have to move

Can we do anything Can we stop it

I do not believe so Captain

The detonation will stretch
half a parsec We need to go

Not until I know theyre safe

The nullspace bubble

will protect the internal
power source not us

Were waiting until they jump

You tried Lets go

Damn it Black alert Jump Now

I understand it was a risk
but it needed to be done

And it worked

Everyones safe The DMAs gone

No more worlds will be destroyed

You can go back I can go home

Once we get the power source

I just need to find it

No

No its here It has to be

Its not here

Tarka

Its powered from the other side
of the wormhole

Outside the galaxy

DOOR CHIMES

Come

NHAN Any word from Book

I keep hailing

He wont answer

What happens now

We have no idea
how the TenC will respond so

the admirals implementing
emergency protocols

in case of retaliation

Were fasttracking
the first contact mission

Commander Bryce is still
looking for ways

to communicate
through the Galactic Barrier

The rest of us leave tomorrow

Did you say your goodbyes

They made me promise
I wont be a stranger

Im going to hold you
to that too CHUCKLES

Please

Thank you for supporting me

reaching out to him one last time

What you said earlier

How nothings ever black and white

I actually did find my family

Most live in this one village

So I went to a park there

There were kids playing
and parents hovering

Same as my parents did

I tried to talk to them but

there was so much I couldnt say

That Im from the past for starters

So I figured if I couldnt

be fully honest with them

Like with us Hmm

You couldnt tell us
you were back in uniform so

All or nothing Thats me

Anyhow I think its time
for me to get okay

with some middle ground

Hmm

Id love to come back
to Discovery one of these days

 If thats okay
 Oh you always have a home here

Good luck out there

You too

SIGHS HEAVILY

CULBER Mr Saru

Long day How are you holding up

Ah as well as could be
expected all things considered

I wanted to commend you for your calm

during todays mission

I only wish wed found success

Yeah

I uh considering
what were dealing with

Feel silly bringing this up but

Im in need of advice
on how best to respond to

an overture from President TRina

An overture

She asked me to join her for dinner

Uh socially

 Oh
 Uh of course I cannot

given the mission at hand
but Im unsure how best

to convey that

even if it were possible

I would decline

We she and I

Hail from vastly different cultures

I already feel pulled
between my commitments

to Kaminar and Starfleet and

Do you have feelings for her

I think

perhaps I do

With respect sir
in my professional opinion

youre being an idiot

Connection is always a risk

but compared to everything else
were dealing with right now

Id say its one that you can handle

Mm Mm

CHRISTOPHER Mr Saru

youre requested
on the bridge immediately

Thank you Doctor

for that unexpected candor

DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN

DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN

SARU Is everything all right Captain

The USS Mitchell is monitoring

the area where the DMA was located

They just sent this

SARU A new DMA has appeared

BURNHAM In the exact same place

Then it would seem like it or not

We just made first contact
