BOOK Pull up Kwejian
on the deepspace array

 BURNHAM What happened
 My ship was hit by something

BOOK Theyre gone

STAMETS Five lightyears across

Thats the size
of the gravitational anomaly

that hit Kwejian

The DMA disappeared

It reappeared  seconds later

 lightyears away

BURNHAM The only logical explanation

is someone created it

VANCE For now were classifying

those responsible
as Unknown Species TenC

ZORA Thank you Commander for reaching toward me

 GRAY What are those
 The coordinates

 To Species TenC
 Im struggling

The DMA has brought up
a lot of uh uncertainty

You are only human

If you dont find fulfillment
in something other than work

then you will fail those
in the chair in front of you

And I designed this

A weapon capable of destroying the DMA

A cascading subspace burst
sounds a lot like the result

of an isolytic explsin

My proposal carries some risk

but not nearly as much as doing nothing

We need to defend ourselves

BURNHAM If we make
first contact peacefully

then we can determine
intent before we act

Introducing the next
generation spore drive

We have seconds
before they realize its gone

and figure out Im the one who took it

Next parts all you

Book No

VANCE I need Bookers ship found

Scramble every available vessel

Eisenberg class shuttle I dont care

Theyve stolen classified tech

Do we have any idea where it is

Negative sir It sporejumped

 Any idea where its headed
 Not yet sir

All available personnel are looking

Can anyone please tell me
how the hell did our prototype

get out in the first place

Security requires dual
authorization does it not

Yes sir It has dual authorization

Uh Ruon Tarka entered his code somehow

in conjunction with uh

 yours sir

RILLAK Admiral

Ill ask you both just once

Did you have any idea this was coming

 BOTH No Madam President
 Okay then

how did you have no idea it was coming

Tarka was your guy Admiral

Handpicked You gave him free reign

Barely any oversight

And it is one thing to miss the capacity

for criminal misbehavior
in a professional relationship

but yours was also personal

I knew Book was struggling
but he he gave no indication

that he would do something like this

Hmm

That spore drive technology
is the closest we have come

to ending our dilithium dependence

If word gets out that
the only functional prototype

has been stolen
it will threaten everything

Including trust that we have the ability

to pull off this monumental
first contact mission

that you just helped to sell
a few hours ago

That doesnt even take into account

the risk we now run of provoking

a highly advanced species
who are capable

of destroying us all
if Booker and Tarka succeed

BURNHAM With all due respect maam

hes a good man
whos not thinking clearly

Hes grieving heshes dealing
with unimaginable loss

He thinks hes preventing
another Kwejian

We are trying to prevent
something even worse

I can get him to see that
before its too late

In order to build an isolytic weapon

Tarka needs isolynium

Thats a blackmarket element
that is not easy to track down

That buys us time to find them

Discoverys primary repairs are done

We can leave immediately

I know you want to help Captain

But youre too close to this

You cannot be involved

Im told Intelligence has
identified four vendors

who are believed to
have access to isolynium

Im deploying ships to all locations

with orders to detain
Booker and Tarka on sight

Good In the meantime Id ask

that Discovery gather data
on Species TenC

We have to prepare for a first contact

provided our rogue associates
dont beat us to it

I agree

You have your orders Captain Burnham

Dismissed

TARKA So howd it feel

The spore drive

The interface Efficiency

Hit me Come on youre
the first real beta tester

 Its impressive
 Oh come on now

Specifics

It works Itll help us stop the DMA

Thats all that matters to me

Cant fault your honesty

Were safe for now
out of scanner range

How long do you need
to build the weapon

hours should do it

 TRILLING
 Shes hailing you again

Yeah And theres this too

TARKA Well its not the most
flattering picture of me

but you you look fantastic

Its not lost on me what
youre giving up to do this

Its worth it whatever
my sentence turns out to be

Your sentence

Once billions of lives
are saved youll be a hero

Thats not how the Federation works

You had half the assembly
eating out of your hand

 We still lost the vote
 Rillaks a political animal

Once the DMA is gone

shell face political
pressure to pardon us

Shell find a way to explain
that in this case

the ends justified the means

Lets just worry about saving
the billions of lives first

Okay

Very well

Once youve secured us some isolynium

 I can finish the third phase of
 Wait what

You made it sound like
you knew exactly how to get it

I was counting on the Federations help

 We dont have that now
 Unbelievable

Whats the issue here

I thought couriers could find anything

Buying something
thats dangerous and rare

is never easy especially
with Starfleet on our asses

LOW BEEPING

I know a place that
wont be on their radar

But its gonna cost us

See Thats the spirit

And dont worry cost wont be an issue

DOOR CHIMES

 Come
 DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN

Admiral

DOOR WHOOSHES CLOSED

I first met Ruon Tarka

when he was giving a lecture
ten years ago

One of the most brilliant minds
Ive ever encountered

He had all these ideas
for new propulsion systems

and power sources

Made it sound like
anything was possible

And I believed him

I still do

I keep asking myself

why would he do this

What am I missing

Sir I wish I had answers

Maybe Tarka couldnt handle the
council voting down his plan

He has quite the ego

 but I dont think thats it

I just got my family back Captain

The thought that I will have
to send them away again

for their protection because
someone I brought into the fold

might invite a war that
we couldnt possibly win

We will figure this out

And I will do everything in my
power to help make things right

I think we can both agree
that Bookers not foolish enough

to buy isolynium from
any of the known suspects

Sir you and President Rillak
were pretty clear

Yes and its very important for
the Federation president and I

to present a united front

so I would never
publicly contradict her

But I can take a page
out of her own book

and encourage you
as one of the most creative

and adept officers in my service

to do everything you can to stop them

within the parameters
of the mission you were given

You find a way Captain Burnham

Thats also an order

 

 

 

ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS

Well the president wants us
to make first contact

sooner rather than later

What have we found at the coordinates

Uh Commander Stamets
was just updating me

But may I say first
we support you Captain

We all do

STAMETS And uh

we hope Books okay

Thank you

What have we got

Well unfortunately not much

Data on what lies
beyond the galactic barrier

is extremely limited

That gap in the center

Is that where the TenC are located

Well um like I said its limited

But the orbit of
the extragalactic stars nearby

indicate a significant
gravitational presence

Theres definitely something there

To find out what well
need a visual on the area

Any idea how to do that

 Zora
 ZORA Yes Commander Stamets

I may have something

The sphere data has records of a civilization

located lightyears away from these coordinates

just inside the galactic barrier

The Stilph Theyre warpcapable

So theyre advanced enough
and close enough

that their standard stellar surveys

should cover the area we need

Zora has the Federation ever
crossed paths with the Stilph

No And no diplomatic relations exist

But theyve dealt with the Orions in the past

Mm Rather complicated intermediaries

We dont have to go through them

I know a broker on Porathia

He has relationships with everyone

He can get us what we need

A broker

Hes an old friend

I will have to make the request myself

Keep combing through
for more data points

 in the meantime
 Yes Captain

ZORA Id be happy to complete that task myself

It is perhaps more tedious than is worthy of your time

Thank you Uh Id appreciate that

Mr Saru

Im bringing Commander Owosekun
to verify the surveys

The Federation isnt exactly welcome

on Porathia so once we jump there

Discovery will need
to keep its distance

Well take a shuttle down

Captain am I correct
in assuming that this broker

is from your courier days
with Mr Booker

Yes

And are President Rillak
and Admiral Vance aware

that you are planning to pursue him

You dont miss much do you

Only when sleepdeprived

Vance unofficially ordered me

to kll two birds with one stone

And I believe this broker

is where Book will go
to get the isolynium

I see

You think Im too close to this

I believe there is no one else
who could possibly convince

Mr Booker to correct his path

but I do not envy your position
should he refuse

Ill be back as soon as I can

Uh be safe Captain

Above all

INDISTINCT VOICE OVER COMMS

DOORS WHOOSH OPEN

BOOK Welcome to Haz Mazaros Karma Barge

Were gonna need to make this fast

TARKA Not what I was expecting

when you said wed find isolynium here

Theres nothing Haz wont
take bets on in the front

or sell in the back

Hell have it Or know someone who does

Charming place

I should probably mention

that we didnt part
on the greatest of terms

Do I need to know the particulars

Only that it was something
I did on my own

Hopefully hes forgotten

cause it doesnt look
like a good day to be here

GUARD Empty out your pockets
Show me your hands

Nothing See

Always wondered where Emerald
Chain dimwits went to die

Listen Haz is fun until hes not

So let me do the talking

Think of me as a shadow

 

Haz know you

Tell him its GlowWorm

GlowWorm Hmm

HAZ GlowWorm

A swamp cat couldve
learned the Hortan Hustle

since I last saw you

Seems like good terms to me

Your timings perfect

Im having a special on Devore scanners

and modified scan deflectors

Whos Mr Personality

My shadow

 Wheres Michael
 Not here obviously

Come on tell your buddy Haz
Whats the what with you two

Still none of your business

Look Im here for
something important okay

TARKA This Devore scanner
couldnt pick out

a Betazoid standing
all alone in a Nieser cage

BOOK Apologies for my associate

His filter was taken from him
by cognition pirates Very sad

Im here for isolynium

Heavy stuff

Why exactly do you need it

Chatty as always I see

Not that I mind Each to his own

 her own their own all the things
 Hmm

I do happen to have access

But itll cost you more than that

TARKA We need proof its pure

Not the usual stuff cut with sammonium

Pay first inspect later

Shadow

BOOK Take it all

 We have a deal
 Ill take your latinum

but we dont have a deal

Old score to settle

Or did you forget

Course not But it wasnt on me

I warned Ertel to stop
delivering Tranceworms

It was dangerous business

It wasnt until you stole his cargo

and he spent six months
trying to get back his losses

Cost me my best customer
in the meantime

Id say that about covers it

 WEAPONS WHIRRING
 We need the isolynium Haz

Werent you listening
I said not without more latinum

Itll take a few days

We dont have a few days

Sorry GlowWorm

Nice seeing you though
Give Michael a hug for me

Haz Haz wait wait Wait

Your guys out there
theyre looking for crooks

or card counters right

Detection tech hasnt worked

I cant even tell you
how many are in the ring

So you got nothing to lose
by letting us try

You keep the latinum
we get the isolynium

Winwin

You got yourself a deal

But jab a brussel fly and
Ill scoot some greenbread

Clear

Crystal

The casino is a dead zone by design

so all of our weapons tech and comms

have to be checked at the door

The Federation has
no authority on Porathia

so well be on our own

And there may be a few surprises

IIm not sure

Any questions

Just one

You can verify stellar surveys yourself

Why bring me

Saru told me what happened
at the subspace rift

How you didnt want to stand
down when he told you to

I was totally out of bounds
II apologized to him

I know

But I also know how it feels

to want to do something Anything

And how it feels when you cant

Thank you

 Right Hook
 BURNHAM CHUCKLING

Starfleet Captain Right Hook CHUCKLES

Tale for another time

This is Lieutenant Commander Owosekun

This is Haz Mazaro

I feel like Im in a time warp today

So uh are you here
as part of Starfleet

Or are we still friends

BURNHAM Both Both

Here to buy some
extragalactic stellar surveys

from a civilization called the Stilph

Theyve had some runins
with the Orions

I may know an Orion or two

But why would you want
pictures of stars

Stars are pretty

HAZ LAUGHS

Everyone is so secretive nowadays

I have missed you like a
Cardassian misses cake

Unfortunately that wont be enough

Ah

And yet she remembers
the way to his heart

Its true what the Elasians say

Give a man a torbak and
you are warm in the desert

Anything else you need

 its yours
 How about isolynium

The plot thickens

You said anything else I need

Should be enough latinum to cover it

Sadly the price goes up
with multiple bidders

and theres already
someone else in play

But perhaps you knew that

 Is the other bidder here now
 He might be

sniffing out some vermin for me

Which gives you two lovelies
a chance to hit

the tables See if you can
at least double that

Ill get your star charts

Open em up

Lets get some tables going in here

 while Im out
 MALE A new room is now open

Its Book isnt it The other bidder

I had a hunch but I wasnt certain

 If you want to wait in the shuttle
 No

Im in

All the way

And for what its worth

theres no way you could
have seen this coming

Thank you Owo

All right Lets do this

INDISTINCT CHATTER

Haz said his detection tech
couldnt find the cheaters

What makes you think that thing will

Given the obsolete kernel patches

on the translators he was hawking

I wouldnt put any faith
in Mr Mazaros judgment

of what technology can or cannot do

BOOK Lots of possible cheats in here

Pickpockets

Card counters

And that guy

Check out his eyes

Where

I lost them Their eyes
were locked on the deck

and they had this
rhythmic blink like a signal

Maybe its how they communicate

Good Thats good

 Ill be back
 Hey What

BURNHAM We need to talk

BOOK SIGHS

How did you find me

CHUCKLES SOFTLY
You really need to ask

You shouldnt be here

Neither should you

Whatever Tarka did or said
to sell you on this

doesnt matter now

Just come back while you still can

If you take the isolynium off the market

and out of Tarkas hands

you could earn some grace
with the Federation

Theyll understand
how you got pulled into this

I wasnt pulled into anything

Tarka and I came to this together okay

 You broke a half dozen laws
 Thats what it takes

to stop that thing
from killing more people

But thats Thats not how
This isnt the way

When you first met me
I had just hijacked

someone elses cargo
to save an endangered species

Are you really surprised
by this Michael

If you buy that isolynium
youll be crossing a line

you cannot come back from

You should leave Michael

Okay Just go back
say you never saw me

I cant do that

Then what are you gonna do

Stop you

INDISTINCT CHATTER

REFEREE If you like a challenge

we need challengers

I was just telling your associate

that the stellar surveys

wont be an issue
but uh theyll take time

No problem

We have some other business
to attend to anyway

Haz how much do you want

to take the isolynium out of play

Three times what you have now

Fine I just need access

 to a comms channel
 Ah

Last thing I need
is more Starfleet sweeping in

no offense and thats
exactly whatll happen

when they find out Books here

I monitor Federation channels
I know whats what

Then you know you cannot sell him

 the isolynium
 HAZ Sure I can

Unless I sell it to you

Im a banta tree either way

OWOSEKUN Books not gonna
change his mind is he

Which means we need to score
a lot of latinum fast

 

OWOSEKUN Got an idea

Its a little crazy

 DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT
 Um Hugh

 The ship cleans for us
 Yeah well

sometimes it needs a little zhuzh

No How many times do I have to say it

Return to dock

Youre stressed

 Im not stressed
 Youre also cleaning

Ergo stressed

Just clearing my head

Is this about Book

He was in a volatile emotional state

and I didnt do enough

This is what Kovich
was warning me about

Pushing myself Wearing myself out

Failing people

What he did is not on you

But it is Im responsible

for the psychological
and emotional health

of everyone on board this ship
Book included

You know

thats a completely unreasonable
expectation to bear

You cant solve

your patients problems

All you can do is help them
find their own answers

I know that I do I just

Its all I can think about

What I couldve done differently

Hugh listen to me

I get anxiety

I mean right now
ImIm toggling between the DMA

and how Gray is settling in
to life on Trill

Is Book okay wherever he is

And lets not forget about how badly

I handled the situation with Zora so

Its not the same as yours

but it all comes from the same place

uncertainty

Which is terrifying

So lets be terrified together

Kovich said you need to take
some time for yourself right

The holodeck just got updated

with the Venabalia bloom

BYSTANDERS EXCLAIMING

CHITTERING

WHIRRING

What in the katterpod and Calaman sherry

 is going on here
 Weve got your latinum

 We got your cheater
 Looks like we got a draw

You should have more than
enough for the isolynium

Doesnt matter He already agreed

 BURNHAM Latinum talks Haz
 BOOK We saved you more

 than I couldve possibly owed you
 And you

should hear this loud and clear

And you always liked me more

 Enough
 That Changeling wouldve ripped you off

for months

HAZ While you two were strutting around

like Klingons in a disco

I reached out to some of my regulars

and found two whod be happy

to take the isolynium off your hands

so you can get back
to your relationship whatnot

There are many ways we can solve

this conundrum but I thought

in honor of how I met you

we should settle it in
the traditional courier fashion

with a game of Leonian Poker

We had a deal Haz

HAZ My raft my rules

You want the isolynium or not

Im in

Then so am I

HAZ Delightful

Usual rules apply

Your latinum buys you in
I keep all of that of course

The winner gets the isolynium
The rest get nothing

Drop out Still nothing

Act like an Armus

Swim the Porathian Ocean
with weighted boots

Any questions

Yes

For a uh a gamble this big

shouldnt we each get a chance
to verify the quality of goods

Fair enough

You first

You know who those two are right

Emerald Chain holdouts

hoping to be the next Osyraa
Yeah I know

Yeah so we dont agree
on a lot of things right now

but we both know they
cannot get the isolynium

I dont plan on losing it to them

Or to you for that matter

Youre great at Leonian Poker

Youre a hell of a lot better than me

But youre no sure thing

No one is

 So
 So

you remember Schaefer Colony

BOOK Mmhmm

Odds can be modified

if we work together

HAZ Next

I got your pretty star pictures

I knew youd come through

Want a Tetryonic Dosimeter
to measure potency

 No thank you
 CHUCKLES

Isolynium has the same
metallic luster as pyrite

and its crystals are equant

meaning they have
roughly equal dimensions

When cut with impurities

opacity and shape are affected so

Learn a lot of useful
things as a courier

This is the real deal

I dont know whats happening
between you two

and Ive never really
been much for love

but for what its worth

I hope it still works out

CHUCKLES SOFTLY

Now for the fifth stretch

Last bet on the hand

And as the saying goes

to the Souvlo goes the spud

Wow

Spices things up a bit

Check

How are you folks doing

Things going well

MATTRUB Bet  

You know Ive played this guy before

Hes good

but he has a tell

WHISPERS Rubs his ear on a good hand

BOOK Call

Oh what to do

What to do What to do

You know I

I played a game once at Schaefer Colony

Therethere was this guy who bet it all

on a new wardrobe
thinking it was his night

only to go home
in the emperors new clothes

on a flush draw CHUCKLES SOFTLY

Not that anybody was complaining

Well looks like Im all talk
CHUCKLES

Lets see it

HAZ LAUGHING

EXHALES

Great action in those
Schaefer Colony games

 

 YAWNS
 Ill raise

Just a little one

Little baby bet yeah

LAUGHS

Im stunned too

Who wouldve thought
with a four and a six 

Its the best night of my life

I dont

They make a pretty good team

Id be sweating a little if I were you

And you are

Lieutenant Commander Owosekun

Tell me

Lieutenant Commander Owosekun

whats your opinion
of what Book and I are doing

I assume you toe the company line

I actually understand why
you saw this as a way to go

 Hmm
 Still a gigantic risk

Hoping it doesnt blow back
on all of us

And to do this against
the advice and will of so many

takes a hell of a big ego no

Im not surprised you think that

What is it then

Youre the Federations genius darling

Why throw it all away
Makes no damn sense

I couldnt care less what
the Federation thinks of me

Its not about them

So who is it about then

Someone whos gone

Died

So this is what revenge

Youre getting back at someone

Or keeping a promise maybe
to that someone who died

Okay youre boring me
Go stand somewhere else

I know what it is to lose someone

You can choose to make
something good come out of it

There are varying degrees of loss

Lieutenant Commander Owosekun

And if you could feel
the weight of mine

if only for a fleeting moment

youd reconsider how much choice one has

with regards to what comes out of it

LOUD THUMP

I dont appreciate bad
behavior at my table

Goodbye

Now for the Battle of Bygone Love

OVERLAPPING DISTANT CHATTER

You know if you win this
and you take that isolynium

every bridge you have ever built
will be incinerated instantly

The bridge between us

will that be gone too

Youd leave me no choice

Starfleet will come after you
with everything theyve got

Ill be one of the tools they use

Doesnt have to be like that

We can end this

Lets end this

All right

Lets end it

HAZ EXHALES

The bets to you Michael

All in

BURNHAM Straight

HAZ Flush

Congratulations GlowWorm

Im sorry

TARKA Sacrifice is always heavy

And though doing it for
the right reasons should help

it never does

In time I do believe Burnham
and others will understand

Maybe

The only thing that would be worse

is that sacrifice done for nothing

Hmm SIGHS

So lets do what we came here to do

end the DMA

For good

RILLAK As I understood it

you were gathering data
for first contact

and doing nothing else

I was there to acquire
a rare set of stellar surveys

Thought it would shed some
light on whats located

at the Cs coordinates

Theyre being analyzed now

Did I hope to run into Book
in the process

Yes that is also true

I cant help but be impressed
by your ability

to navigate a loophole Captain

Wouldnt be surprised if you had
some inspiration either

I am troubled however
that you were not able

to make your loophole count

You should have found a way to
drag Booker and Tarka back here

With respect Madam President

she was outside Federation territory

without a weapon without
a badge without authority

Be that as it may she literally
bet it all and lost

Not quite Book is incredible
at Leonian Poker

so going into the game I
already knew that I would lose

So I made the best play
that I could with the hand

that I was dealt

When cut with impurities

opacity and shape are affected so

I planted a tracker

Same kind Starfleet put
in dilithium shipments

back when deliveries were being stolen

And as you may remember
Madam President

the signal can be detected
from multiple sectors away

Not many people have the ability
to surprise me Captain Burnham

I wont deny what Book means to me

But I also wont compromise
my commitment

to the safety of the
Federation and everyone in it

Theyre not moving

Tarkas assembling the weapon

Well only have one shot
at surprising them

It has to count

Well begin missionplanning
immediately

SARU Apologies for the interruption Admiral

but Commander Stamets

has something very important to show you

It cannot wait

This is what we found
at the species coordinates

Their technological capabilities

are beyond our wildest assumptions

How do you conclude that from this

It looks like a blob

Natural astrophysical objects

emit a broad spectrum
of black body radiation

This does not

Therefore it can only be artificial

And whatever it is

its million kilometers in radius

Thats enough to contain a host star

with two or three orbiting bodies

Any signals being emitted
from inside of this thing

None that we can register

The structure
a hyperfield of some kind

seems to function
as some sort of Faraday cage

We have no way of knowing whats inside

Must be astronomical
the amount of energy

required to maintain that

VANCE Where would
all that energy come from

Zora analyze the areas
of space left behind

after the DMA changed location

What are you thinking

The remaining gases
and elements should all fall

within known statistical parameters

but if something specific
is missing like boronite

Boronite Of course

Mr Saru if you dont mind

Boronite is an element
that forms naturally

albeit in infinitesimal quantities

In sufficient amounts however
it can be synthesized

into some of the most powerful
substances in existence

Would there be enough energy
for this hyperfield of theirs

And then some

ZORA Your hypothesis was correct Captain

Theres no trace of boronite at any

of the DMAs prior known locations

The DMA removed it

They mined it

Thats the purpose of the DMA

Thats why it seems to move so randomly

Its not a weapon

Its a dredge

If the DMA is their mining equipment

we can only imagine
what their weapons are like

And if their power supply is threatened

it will almost certainly
be seen as a hostile act

Booker and Tarka must be stopped

Whatever the cost

I know
