STAMETS The DMAs gone

from the Venari sector

It just It disappeared

The only logical explanation
is someone created it

I want to create a working model

of the DMA controller

Thats how it works

Its creating the subspace rupture too

BURNHAM The DMA is now on a path
towards the Radvek asteroid belt

We will get everyone out

We need to do more Michael

We need to find out
whos behind this and stop them

We will

ADIRA What are you gonna do today

Other than the zhiantal exercises

Mind and body connection is everything

especially when you have a new body

This colony is in path
of a gravitational anomaly

We are here to evacuate you

Unlike the others I do belong here

I took a life

Among the things I stole was the familys lalogi orb

 Im staying
 We have to save him

 Its his choice to make
 This is wrong

ZORA It can be painful to weigh duty against compassion

 You feel emotions
 It is a recent development

I believe this may belong to you

 

BURNHAM Ive been thinking a lot about family

How the past is still so much of the present

How even when someone is gone

we remain connected to them

Our memories

our feelings

Its like theyre still here with us in some way

Its comforting you know

BOOK It can be

Thats impressive

I was inspired by the lalogi orb

The thing Felix gave you

Book

Oh weve talked about it enough

It was your call not mine

Today would have been my dads birthday

I know you two werent close

Yeah Id never put his face

on a family tree thats for sure

Anyway you heard from the admiral yet

SIGHS

Were going into the subspace rift

left behind by the DMA

 Hmm
 hours

Right

He said thatsthats it for now

Were missing opportunities

You can keep reaching out
to your courier contacts

Whoever created the DMA

is someone the Federations
never encountered

We need to jump
outside the Federation space

Talk to them

Come on theythey might have leads

Right now we have a crime scene

and we have to get there
while the evidence is fresh

 I know but
 The DMA must have left

something behind in that rift

And particle analysis
will tell us what it is

and where it came from
and where leads to who

Stamets is confident So is Tarka

I hope to hell theyre right

CHIMES

ZORA Captain Mr Saru is ready for you

BURNHAM Well find who did this

MEOWS

Well figure it out girl

We are closing
on the subspace rift Captain

Uh in reviewing Starfleet
records of similar encounters

it appears we can anticipate
some interference

Uh Enterprise noted heated plasma

Voyager charted ionizedparticle eddies

 So itll be bumpy
 Mm

Our warp drive
will need to remain offline

And as Commander Stamets is uncertain

of the rifts impact
on the mycelial network

uh it is not prudent
for us to jump in either

CHUCKLES Bumpy and slow Got it

Oh nothing we cannot handle Im sure

The crews spirits are high

Good

 And yours
 Oh

I am relieved that we
may soon understand

the origins of the DMA

BURNHAM You and me both Bridge

DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT

Zora call all bridge personnel
to stations please

ZORA Thank you Captain

Its only polite

Did you 

We ran level ten diagnostics Twice

Theres no irregularities

ZORA All systems are operating

within the defined parameters Mr Saru

It seems my emotional development

is an organic evolution

yet I can tell the captain still has concerns

I understand of course

Were in uncharted territory

Theres a lot to consider

Carry on Zora

CHIMES

ZORA All crew report to stations

MALE Lets go

That mean the missions approved

Oh it damn well better be

 I am so ready for answers
 Heres hoping

 CHIMES
 ZORA Repeat all crew

report to stations

Oh Um

okay Dont move any
of the pieces till I get back

That ruins my plan to cheat

Go You dont want to be late

for your first bridge assignment

Well its not like
an actual assignment

You know ImIm just filling in

I kind of feel bad for Linus

spending all day under a heating lamp

 Poor guy Quit delaying Go
 Okay

Um and youll be okay right

Ill keep busy You know me Go

One thing we know about the DMA

is that it tears
the hell out of subspace

Our mission today

is to go to that most recent tear

and find any clues the DMA left
behind Molecular compounds

thermal radiation

residual ions industrial remnants

Anything that can lead us
to whoever created it

Commander Detmer
Bring us in on impulse

Aye Captain

 

RUMBLING

Status report

Passing through the plasma barrier

Shields are heating up
but holding at 

BURNHAM Zora

ZORA All other systems are nominal

Commencing scans now

RUMBLING STOPS

Isnt it supposed to be bumpy

This is indeed unexpected

Are we inside the rift

 Should be
 What do you mean should

DETMER We passed
through the barrier I

 I dont have any nav readings
 OWOSEKUN Im not getting

any scan data at all

I dont understand it

Have sensors been damaged Zora

ZORA No damage found

I am unable to determine why external sensors

arent receiving input

Longrange comms are down too

Owosekun can you get us visuals

Those are the visuals Captain

Thats it Thats all there is

This is wholly inconsistent
with the data

from other missions

Well the subspace rifts they went into

werent created by the DMA

Commander Bryce what do you hear

Its what Im not hearing Captain

Space is loud Stars nebulae planets

They all normally give off
electromagnetic frequencies

 But this
 Convert it to audio

put it on speaker All frequencies

Aye Captain

So theres just nothing

Uh I mean
its scientifically impossible

for there to be nothing out there

Theres definitely something
We just have to assume

its not registering
on any of our sensors

Agreed Ensign Book

 you got a visual
 BOOK Yeah

 Taking in the view
 Are your sensors

 getting anything
 Nothing

Ill do some recon

Wait Let me send a DOT first

Im powered up

Five minutes

 GRUDGE PURRS
 She said five minutes

MEOWS

Commander Nilsson
launch a DOT starboard bow

 and put it onscreen
 Aye Captain

BURNHAM Activate onboard camera

NILSSON Aye Captain

 Status report
  meters out

Its scanners are active
and reading Captain

No data yet

OWOSEKUN  meters out

BURNHAM Run a full spectrum analysis

NILSSON Nothing

Captain Not in any spectrum

We should be getting
a ton of data by now

 meters out

Looks like weve got some
interference in the signal

No Somethings happening

Pull it back Nilsson Now

Its not responding to commands

Book are you seeing this

Yeah Its not good

 Nilsson
 Its still not responding

HIGHPITCHED SQUEALING

It sounds like its

Screaming

BOOK Michael

Im gonna find Paul

If I cant fly I got to do something

BURNHAM Yeah Good idea

Weve lost the DOTs
camera feed Captain

Shut it off

 Do we know what happened
 NILSSON No idea

It was just eaten

ItItsits possible
the DMA has done something

to subspace itself

Turned it toxic

SARU Then we must ensure
that what happened to the DOT

does not happen to us

BURNHAM Mr Saru is right

We need answers

And with or without sensor data
were gonna get them

Is that understood

ALL Aye Captain

 Red alert
 ALARM BLARING

 

 

 

ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS

BURNHAM Ensign Tal was right

There is something out there

We may not be able to see it
but it has an edge

The DOT hit it

And that may be the DMA clue
weve been looking for

We just have to figure out what it is

So lets get creative

Mr Saru

Perhaps we might find a way

to see what our sensors cannot scan

Yes Commander Rhys

prep a photonic flare
Same trajectory as the DOT

 Aye Captain
 If you match the DOTs velocity

I could chart the time differential

Good Ensign Tal

Commander Stamets
is standing by for analysis

once we have data of any kind

All right then Light it up

 meters

 meters out

It took  seconds
for the DOT to disintegrate

 for the flare

So whatevers out theres
getting closer

Closing in at a rate
of  meters per second

How long before it reaches us

Approximately minutes

Okay so we need to slow it down

keep it away from the ship

Extend shields outward

 maximum reach
 OWOSEKUN Aye Captain

But Ill need more power to sustain

Commander Stamets if youre sitting

on any extra power were gonna need it

Uh sure I think Ive got some
tucked away under my chair

I knew you would

Put me to work Whatever you need

Oh great Um help ramp down
any nonessential functions

and redirect power since I dont
actually even have a chair

Oh and um thank you

Im glad youre here

GRAY Zora Whats going on

Why did the captain call for red alert

Is there anything I can do to help

ZORA As you arent commissioned

no action is required at this time

Thats vague Come on

there must be something you can tell me

A DOT module and a photonic flare

were destroyed by something I am unable to identify

No offense but is that normal

No its not

Since arriving in this rift

Ive stopped receiving external sensor input

So its like you cant feel anything

 Youre numb
 Not entirely

Internal sensors remain fully functional

but for unknown reasons

I cant prioritize normal data processes

At present I am acutely aware that there is a   variance

in shuttle bay climate control

Replicators on Deck require service

Heat lamp sensors for Lieutenant Linus

 show an energy increase of two percent
 Whoa

I get it

Its like if my brain
started consciously reporting

every breath and heartbeat

EXHALES You must be so overwhelmed

I know its not a normal computer response

I hope that doesnt worry you

Im training to be a Guardian

Thats all about mixing
the scientific and spiritual

I know its not exactly the same but

I appreciate your efforts to understand

Have you tried resetting
your routing system

Maybe thatd help

It didnt Oxygen levels on mess hall Deck Five

are nominal

Was that a joke

If it was funny then yes

How about we play a game

An odd request given the circumstances

Was that a joke

No But it might help clear your head

You know what I mean

If it wouldnt distract you
from your other duties

It wont but I fail to understand

how this can lead to a solution

I dont know either but
Ive been playing this game

to help me assimilate into my new body

And maybe

if it helps you too

then Im not just a passenger

hanging out in the lounge all day

Itd be nice to feel useful

In that case I would love to play

BURNHAM Commander Stamets we need more help with shields

STAMETS Thats it for power Captain

Any more and I have
to start shutting down

essential functions
on one or more decks

Owosekun

Extended shields down to 

Bring them in ten meters
Adira anything

Uh no but uh ImIm trying

We currently have no ability to
complete our scientific mission

and whatever is out there
is getting closer

faster than we expected

I know

Abort the mission

Were getting out of here

Captain we cant leave without answers

Well find another way to get them

 Detmer reverse course
 DETMER Aye Captain

COMPUTER BLIPPING

Im trying I should
be able to rechart

a course using galactic positioning

but its not working

SARU This void

We have no reference points within it

If I go the wrong direction
I could take us deeper in

Zora can you triangulate

a navigational reference
using prior flight path data

ZORA No Captain I cannot

Commander Stamets

We need you to jump us out of here now

Jumping carries unknown risks Captain

BURNHAM So does staying

Have someone monitor systems
during the jump

If the DMA caused this any
data we get will be valuable

Someone else might miss something

Ill make the jump
You focus on the data

STAMMERS I uh

I suppose nows as good a time
as any to learn to delegate

BURNHAM You ready Book

Ready

Black alert

ALERT BLARING

Jump

WARBLING

 YELLS
 Abort Abort

POWERING DOWN

BURNHAM Whats happening

He initiated the shutdown matrix

Commander Stamets report

STAMETS Its Book

He was hit by an energy
surge of some kind

He seems okay

But

the mycelial network
itself seems to be

Oh

Uh we cant jump Captain

Were stuck

YELLS

MUFFLED No abort Abort

Its Book he was hit

by an energy surge of some kind

He seems okay

Dad

Tareckx Been a long time

No no no no no

Thats not possible

Youre dead

You dont say

Never came to pay your respects

Wasnt sure if you even knew

What the hell is this

I was wondering the same thing

Our planets gone and youre
sitting on someone elses ship

letting yourself be ordered around

Communing with mushrooms

 What a waste of your gifts
 Thats enough

Theres an enemy out there son

You should be hunting it

This

this is not real

Hey are you okay

Yeah did you see that

Yeah that was a hell of a surge

It went right through you
Lets get you to sickbay

 Im fine Im good
 No well let Hugh decide that

Come on

BURNHAM Book you okay

Hes stable All vitals normal

I saw my father Michael

It was so real

I could smell the Tuli sap on his hands

A full sensory hallucination

It looks like it

SIGHS First Leto and now him

Am I 

No

Leto was grief made manifest

This was a physiological response

to the energy surge you experienced

The average Kwejian has
a cortical dream center

that fires times per second
in an active state

Your neurotransmitters
are currently firing

at ten times that rate

And how long do they last

These hallucinations

Well its hard to say
but were already seeing

small percentage decreases
in the firing rate

I expect the trend to continue

What hes saying is

youll be all right eventually

We know what happened Paul

Uh yes and no so

this is what the mycelial
network normally looks like

And this

is the network here in the void

Its why I didnt
want us jumping at all

When Book tried it was as if he

touched a live electrical wire

If we still used wires

And these holes are caused
by the same thing thats

 eating though our shields I assume
 Yeah

 So what now
 Now science

Whatever energy passed

through Book during the jump
left trace amounts in his brain

And once we finish analyzing it

we should know something about the void

Whatwhat caused it where it came from

maybe even how to get out of it

Your turn Zora

 BLIPPING
 Nice

And cool name by the way

ZORA Thank you

In some of the cultures Ive encountered

on Earth Baku and NiVar

the name means dawn or new day

I thought it fitting all things considered

I chose my name too

Not because of the meaning

I just liked it

I like it as well

This isnt just a game is it

What makes you say that

I find that Im less overwhelmed since we began

 of my lowpriority processes have returned to the background

I hoped that would happen

 Why is this game 
 BLIPS

Wait

Is everything okay

Now that my systems arent overwhelmed anymore

I can detect something unusual on the exterior hull of Deck 

You should tell the captain

I dont have sufficient data I cant identify the cause

Zora you need to tell her

How are shields holding
I had to bring them in closer

Theyre right at the hull now

ZORA Captain there may be an issue

with the aft corridor on Deck 

What kind of issue

Internal sensors are engaging

Pressure is fluctuating rapidly

Decreasing   per second

Bryce who do we have in the area

Dr Pollards on her way
to check in on Linus

Have her get eyes on this first

Im nearly there Stand by

 CREW CLAMORING
 Get out

 Go Go Go  CORTEZ Im almost done

BURNHAM Whats happening Dr Pollard

Go We have a hull breach

 Cortez you need to get out of here
 I got to fix it

 Or itll blow  ZORA Attention

automated containment field activating

 in three two
 Cortez

 Beam out
  one

SCREAMS

ALARM SOUNDING

Dr Pollard did he get out

No

SIGHS

 ALARM STOPS
 What happened

ZORA The alarm isnt necessary anymore

The hull was compromised

I had to lower an emergency containment field

Ensign Cortez was trapped

He didnt survive

Its hard

Wanting to help and

not being able to do anything

But if you hadnt stepped in sooner

a lot more of us
might be dead right now

 Maybe
 Wait

You said you felt something on
the exterior of the hull right

Thats correct

Then your external sensors
are getting some kind of input

I have to tell them

BRYCE Im getting reports
Decks through

have multiple areas that are thinning

Have personnel moved
and seal those decks

And reroute power to bolster
containment fields and shields

 Aye Captain
 Commander Owosekun

how much longer will shields hold

Approximately minutes
until hull damage is critical

BURNHAM We need more options

Captain Its Zora

I think she can help us get out of here

 Im listening Make it fast
 Theres a Trill game

that Guardians teach
to hosts when they first join

to help with sensory confusion

Where does Zora come in

Her internal sensors
were overwhelming her

You mean that metaphorically right

No it was an emotional response

ZORA I was having trouble focusing

I asked if shed run
a full diagnostic she had

I tested to see if shed
respond to a direct request

And she did

I asked her to play the game
with me and it helped

She registered the problem on Deck

before it reached the hull

Zora can you explain this

 Thats Zora
 ZORA It is

Hello To answer your question Captain

at first I couldnt register any external input

The game helped me settle and focus

I was then able to detect microvariances

in my external sensors as on the hull

Greater focus creates greater awareness

Captain

if we could generate a signal

that can penetrate the void then

Then she should be able to follow it

and lead us out of here

Nice work Gray

ZORA I apologize Captain

But I dont believe that I can do that

Start brainstorming ways we can
get a signal through the void

CREW Aye Captain

Gray youre with me

Zora please join us in the ready room

TARECKX Youre just going to sit there

How obedient youve become

You never used to listen to me

The couriers could have answers

Yet here you are

Youre not here

You should take off that amulet

A coward has no place
wearing the Ikhu Zhen

This is just me

Its my subconscious

 Its not possible
 This from the man who once

believed that even
Tranceworms had spirits

CHUCKLES I remember you crying to me

Father I can feel

their pain

What about the pain of your people

 as they were mrderd
 It wasnt my fault

Look at me Look at me

Blood for blood

Life for a life That is
the Kwejian hunters creed

I know the oath

Ive felt each of their deaths
a thousand times over

And Ill avenge them the second
I know whos responsible

Youd already know
if youd followed your gut

Instead you wait and do nothing

Because she tells you to

Because you love her

Yeah

I do

Her agenda is not your agenda

Anger drives you as it did me

Its time to stop denying that Tareckx

I am nothing like you

And that is not my name anymore

RHYS We could fire photon torpedoes a series of them




    

Carve a path for a signal
to get through

That wouldnt be any more effective

than the DOT or the flares

I could just pick a direction

If were lucky were near an edge

Oh thats just if were lucky

RUMBLING

Maybe we should run another simulation

SARU Let us continue
at stations please

OWOSEKUN Mr Saru

Containment fields are
weakening in Engineering

Permission to take a team to reinforce

the fields with
programmablematter blast doors

 Request denied
 We cant let anyone else die sir

The risks outweigh
any possible benefits

I can do this if you let me

Ill go by myself
if you think its too risky

 for the team
 This is not a debate Commander

We need you at your station
and that is an order

Yes sir

Commander Nilsson

please dispatch a team
of DOTs to the area

Aye sir

The uncertainty we are facing

is deeply unsettling

But I believe we can meet this moment

and do what needs to be done

Now let us do what we can from here

CREW Aye Mr Saru

ZORA I cannot help Captain

I am afraid of whatever is out there

I failed you

It is my fault that Ensign Cortez was lost

Youre feeling guilt

I also fear youve stopped trusting me Captain

Have you

That doesnt matter right now

We need you to get through this

And what youre feeling is
normal in a dangerous situation

Overwhelm and guilt
when someone is harmed

But you are not to blame

I disagree Captain

When I was ten

my mother and father were attacked

I hid in a cabinet listening

I lost them

And I blamed myself for years

You were a child

There was nothing you could have done

I am a sentient organism living inside

of a supercomputer capable of running countless

probabilistic scenarios

Youre talking about logic

Im talking about feelings

It can be very uncomfortable
to accept the truth

that some things are beyond our control

But we have to

Otherwise

we run into the same walls

over and over and over again

Or we freeze up

Either way we dont move forward

Understand

ZORA I do

And when you give me a signal Ill follow it

For all of us

Were counting on it Zora

POLLARD Captain we need you in sickbay Its urgent

Weve isolated the energy
particles that passed

through Book during the jump

At the rate theyre decaying
the hallucinatory effects

should disappear
in about an hour maybe less

Best news Ive heard all day

And it gets better because in this case

your symptoms turn out
to be our solution

These particles in Books brain

are the DMA clue weve been looking for

And theyre only found in one place

The galactic barrier

But were nowhere near
the edge of the galaxy

 Exactly
 So if the DMA brought these

along for the ride
then it must have come

from outside our galaxy

As did the species who made it

All this time I thought
itd be an enemy that wed know

Yeah

These particles were
they created by the void

I dont think so Im guessing

this mess is
a byproduct of whatever device

powering the DMA
is doing to space itself

But assuming the DMA is
from outside our galaxy

it should have deposited more particles

at the point where it punched in

So if we locate the greatest
concentration of particles

we can use that puncture
point to get out

We found a way out

Theres an extragalactic
energy particle

Stamets sent you the signature

Now calculate what type of signal

can possibly reach it at distance

How are we doing on shields

About ten minutes left Captain

Captain will Zora be able to assist us

She will

Got it These particles will resonate

at kilohertz exactly

Thats sonar frequency

Sonar

Sound navigation and ranging

Its an old th century
echolocation technology

Basically we hit the particles
with electromagnetic energy

at that frequency

translate the response
into an audible ping

 And then follow that sound out
 Thats the idea

Gray I want you here
on the bridge for this

Zora send a pulse

at kilohertz

Lets see if this works

ZORA Executing

FREQUENCY ECHOES

Zora can you follow that
to the highest concentration

 of particles
 Yes I can

Captain based on the time it took

for the pulse to return to the ship

were gonna lose shields
before we get out

And once we hit the plasma barrier

the friction

Will heat the ship beyond safe levels

So this wont work

Unless

What if everyone goes
into the pattern buffer

Is that even possible
for the period of time required

ZORA There are Starfleet records documenting

longterm survival in a pattern buffer

The risks arent insignificant

Meaning we could all die

Well if the alternative

is being slowly eaten by the void

It would seem that your suggestion is

our best option Captain
all things considered

Zora prepare the pattern buffer

Yes Captain

BURNHAM Ill be right here with you

A captain always stays with her ship

Ill appreciate the company

Commander Bryce

open a shipwide channel please

CHIMES

All personnel prepare to transport

into the pattern buffer

Please do so in groups No one
should go into this alone

Ill stay here on the bridge
to monitor systems

I will bring you out once
we have safely exited the rift

Thank you all for your courage

And your trust

See you on the other side

Zora prepare to shut down
life support on my order

ZORA Yes Captain

You did great today

You too badass

Hey Zora

Youve got this

Thank you Gray

Mr Saru before we go

I owe you an apology

When I was younger
my best friend got sick

She needed more help than our
communitys healers could give

I wanted to do something but
there was nothing to be done

And in the end

all I could do was watch her die

I felt powerless

You bore witness Commander

That is something

And I thank you
for sharing her story with me

Shall we

Come on girl

Lets have an adventure

Nice ship

The wall panels

I see you tried to simulate
the wood of the Tuli tree

Classy

Listen I know why you hated me

I hunted creatures
our people considered sacred

But I didnt choose that path

The Emerald Chain forced me
to hunt them

To pay for their protection

I couldnt fight back

I lost you because I was weak

Now I see that same weakness in you

Its not weakness to trust
someone you love Dad

Its strength

Even still

She will pick Starfleet over you

over Kwejian every time

And one day

youll be the one who has to choose

I dont know if this is actually you

But Im gonna choose to believe it is

Rather than some part
of my subconscious

Because if spirits do go on

that means Leto

Kyheem

everyone else Ive lost

theyre not gone after all

Not really

Goodbye Dad

And happy birthday

Ready

ZORA Warning life support termination imminent

 Hey
 Hey

You all right

 Yeah you
 Yeah

Uh I just needed to um

see you before

Im glad

 I know things have been a little rough lately
 Yeah

 I love you Michael
 I love you too

GRUDGE MEOWS

Yeah I think shes finally
warming up to you

Yeah I think were tight now

Ill see you soon

Be safe

 

Zora

ZORA Im here Captain

Put the signal on speaker please

PINGING

Should I turn off life support now

Yes

Proceed on impulse

Aye Captain

Lets do this

PINGING

Zora is there interference

ZORA No Captain

Then whats happening

Are we able to follow the signal out

It is increasingly difficult to discern it

There are rapidly expanding pressure leaks

hull breaches on Decks and 

the replicator on Deck Five will fail in three minutes

Zora

Focus

You can do this

Im afraid Captain

I am too

Ive been trying to play Grays game

to quiet the distractions

Its not working anymore

Its not about the game

It never was

It was you

You have control
over your own processes

Okay You just need to focus

You said one has to accept emotions

but also move forward

May I ask you how you do that when youre afraid

I make decisions

I try to use the fear

Tell myself itll make me stronger

Emotions we feel they can shape us

Losing my parents

I wouldnt wish that on anyone
but it made me who I am

We are entering the plasma barrier

BURNHAM I understand

Lets keep talking

ZORA You believe your experience with suffering

has made you stronger and more empathetic

Yes

And I believe what youre feeling now

will make you stronger too

 GRUNTS
 Multiple systems

are failing Captain

Were losing a large section of the hull

Theyre a part of me I feel them dying

GRUNTS You can do this

You can do this Zora Hang on

Status report

Weve lost shields

Captain the temperature on the bridge

will soon exceed EV suit safety parameters

GROANS Zora

Youll have to be the one
to free the crew

from the pattern buffer

Do you understand what Im asking you

Yes Captain

When its safe GASPS SOFTLY

STRAINING Free them when its safe

I will I care for them very much

I wont let them down

I believe you

BREATHING SHAKILY

And Zora I do trust you

Well exit the plasma barrier in four minutes

Are you in physical distress Captain

I think I could use
a little distraction right now

I can sing you a song

A song

GRUNTS Sure Zora

Id love a song

 Dont know why 

 Theres no sun up in the sky 

 Stormy weather 

 Since my man and I 

 Aint together 

 Keeps rainin all the time 

 Life is bare 

 Gloom and misery everywhere 

 Stormy weather 

 And I cant get myself together 

 Im weary all the time 

CULBER Captain

Captain

Are you with us

Hey Welcome back

EXHALES

GRUNTS SOFTLY You made it

BOOK Mmhmm

Did everyone

I am pleased to report that
all crew members made it safely

out of the pattern buffer

ZORA Well done Captain

You too Zora

INHALES

CHUCKLES

WHISPERS Come here

BOTH CHUCKLE

Programmable matter is a unique marvel

To enable repairs so quickly

and with such finesse

Something weighs on your mind

Whoevers behind the DMA
is from outside our galaxy

How do we even find them

Commander Stamets believes

that further analysis
of the energy particles

will allow us to determine
their coordinates

My father had so much anger in him

I told myself Id never be like that

Maybe I am

All I want to do is destroy them

EXHALES

I understand

The Baul culled my people

for centuries

My parents died at their hands

Now I sit across from them
at the Kaminar council

I still feel rage

But you seem so balanced

So calm I

We are both justified in our anger

Allowing it to be our focus however

only prevents us from achieving

those things which
serve the greater good

It is a struggle yes

But a worthy one

ZORA It appears youve nearly finished

What do you think

Past present and future as one

Its a powerful image of hope and connection

A fitting way to end this day

Yeah

Yeah I think so too

Ive witnessed many examples of such connectedness

but Ive never before experienced it myself

Im glad you did today

Id like to create a tree of my own if you dont mind

Of course

 

Its beautiful

I hope the crew would agree

CHUCKLES SOFTLY

I think they will

This is different

but its good

Its special

Im so glad youre with us Zora

As am I Captain
