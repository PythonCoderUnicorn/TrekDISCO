Mr Saru

I hope Im not disturbing you

Not at all It is always
a pleasure to hear from you

Do you have feelings for her

Perhaps I do

The power source
that controls the device

I need it to go home

 A place where we could be free
 Whos we

A friend

A scientist like me

I took what I learned about the device

at the center of the DMA
and designed this

a weapon capable of destroying it

BURNHAM And what Im about
to propose is a plan

President Rillak and
Admiral Vance approved

If that fails

theyll back your plan
to destroy the controller

Well stand down for a week

 What are you doing
 Im being clearheaded

No

TARKA Its not here
The power source

its powered from the other
side of the wormhole

Outside the galaxy

A new DMA has appeared

 In the exact same place
 What happens now

The admirals implementing
emergency protocols

in case of retaliation

Were fasttracking
the first contact mission

Whatever we think we know
about Species TenC

were wrong

However we think first contact
will go it wont

The fact that the DMA controller
was destroyed

then reappeared
tells us nothing concrete

Our mere arrival could be perceived

as an act of aggression

We did attack their technology
with an isolytic weapon

We did not

Tarka and Booker acted unilaterally

BURNHAM How would the TenC
know the difference

We have to find a way
to communicate the distinction

NDOYE Isnt that what all these
translators are for

KOVICH No theyre here in case
you feel like translating

confirmation bias
from Federation Standard

into Klingon

LAUGHS

Confirmation bias

Hes saying the universal
translators been so successful

because we tend to look for
and find whats familiar to us

Species that communicate
verbally for example

But since we know nothing
about the TenC

its naive to assume
the translator would even work

It was funny

Dr Hirai is a specialist
in astrolinguistics

uh xenophonology
and theoretical semiotics

TRINA If I may

the very purpose of this task force

is to establish the parameters
for successful communications

Are you both now suggesting
that may be impossible

KOVICH Vulcan surveyed Earth

for almost a century
before making first contact

Discovery leaves in fewer than hours

We have to start the
communication process somewhere

The oversight committee has questions

As do the planetary delegates

Its nice that theyre all so eager

for a threehour tour
outside the galaxy

It will take longer than three hours

Figure of speech

Ah

Point being

I understand their emotional
desire to be present

when we make contact

I wish I could be there myself

 Youre not coming
 Unfortunately

there are other urgent matters
that I must attend to

I cannot fathom anything
even remotely as urgent as this

 KOVICH And I intend to keep it that way
 SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY

Youre in good hands with Dr Hirai

Uh Madam President Admiral

If youll come with me

STAMETS Scan data shows
that the new DMA controller

is the same size
but significantly more powerful

than the one that Tarka
and Book destroyed

Its churning through space
at a much faster rate

How long before it moves
to a new harvesting location

hours at most

VANCE Are we looking at a precursor

for a retaliatory attack

Theres no way to know sir

RILLAK Any word from Mr Booker

He and Tarka cannot escalate
this situation further

I have not heard from him maam

But given the new timetable

I think we should make first
contact as soon as possible

A number of delegates
are still on their way

including the representative
from NiVar

But I agree we cant afford to wait

How soon can you be ready Captain

Two hours

To finish loading and to give my crew

time to say their goodbyes

Two hours it is

Yes sir Madam President

Its a hell of a thing

RILLAK Yes it is

Admiral its my constitutional
duty to inform you

that Im transferring power
to the vice president

Excuse me

Ill be joining the mission

Madam President you

I was the Federations
top ambassador for years

Given the complexities that well face

I believe my skills will be needed

Theyre leaving the galaxy
Weve never done that

You know as well as I do
Discovery might not

be coming back from this

Which is why I am counting on you

to support the vice president
in my absence

However long it may be

Laira

You are the Federation now

What your presence means

what you represent

Makes it all the more crucial

that I be there when we make contact

I cant talk you out of this can I

No

But you have gotten us through so much

Wherever the DMA goes next what

whatever is to come

 I know youll get us
through that too

Found a habitable planet nearby for you

They havent discovered electricity yet

but youll do fine

Heres your bag Well
be there in a few minutes

Hold on

I understand that youre
a little upset but

The DMAs back and more powerful
because you wouldnt stand down

All evidence pointed
to an internal power source

Thats science
Hypothesize test iterate

Now thanks to me
we know the power source

has to be outside the galaxy
within the TenCs hyperfield

Youre welcome

And just to be clear
I didnt stand down

because I was following our plan

We both acted unilaterally

but only one of us
put more lives at risk

I got the hyperfield
coordinates from Haz

Im stopping the DMA
before it moves again

And how do you expect to get
through the galactic barrier

You must know the mycelial network

cant exist in there right

You have to jump up
as close as you can get

The barrier has some
especially nasty sections

The negative energy
will eat through shields

and fry a frontal cortex like that

But surely you have a plan

Ill figure something out

Assuming you make it how do you plan

to find the power supply and remove it

Come on tell me Hit me with it

Youre an asshle You know that

Im also the guy who created
a working model of the DMA

without ever having seen it

How do we get through the barrier

Programmable antimatter

We need to apply it to our shields

Discovery will have
to do the same thing

Itll repel negative energy

like two magnets with the same polarity

And how will you find some
without getting us caught

in the process

Surely you have a plan

I know where theres a stash

SARU Discovery will leave as soon
as shield upgrades are complete

Im sorry you wont be
joining us Commander Bryce

but I trust your work
for Dr Kovich is going well

It is

Uh not sure well figure out
galacticbarrier communication

soon enough to help with first contact

but a breakthrough anytime
would be huge

I mean the possibilities
it would open up

everything thats beyond
our galaxy to explore

IIm pretty excited obviously

IIll miss you guys though

A voyage of this kind without you

will be quite the adjustment

Though I am happy for you

and the opportunities this has created

Good luck out there

And thank you Mr Saru for everything

INDISTINCT CHATTER

SARU Madam President

Do you have a moment

Of course

When last we spoke

you suggested we might share a meal

I would very much like
to take you up on that offer

But Discovery

is leaving very shortly and

as you know we may not

So I thought I should

 um tell you while Im able

how much our new friendship
has meant to me

And how much Ive enjoyed
working alongside you

In any event

I feel as if

there could be something here

 perhaps more than a friendship

WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY

Uh Mr Saru if you will excuse me

Ah

 Ensign Tal
 Hi

Welcome back

 Thank you
 How is Gray

Uh heshes great

Um hes really enjoying
his guardian training

I think were both right
where we need to be

BURNHAM Im glad you feel that way

Its really good
to have you with us again

Isnt it I mean theyve already

put us ahead of schedule with
the shield upgrades and now

theyre off to monitor
the forward emitters

for the mission

Its really not that big a deal

It is though

Theyre gonna take a lot
of damage along the way

and if youre not repairing them

we wont make it
through the barrier at all

I think Im gonna j go back to work

If thats okay Um Captain

Hang in there

Youre doing great

COMM CHIMES

MALE Captain the president is ready for you

Given some of the issues that came up

on our last mission together

I thought we should take
a moment to speak frankly

Please

If Im to bring us through
the galactic barrier safely

I cant have you questioning
my orders on the bridge

I presume were now clear

on the difference between asking
a question and questioning

We are But I hope its also
clear that introducing doubt

amongst my crew could endanger the ship

It is

And understood

 Thank you
 You should also know

this is all quite delicate politically

I need to manage this
situation as I see fit

So while your
xenoanthropological expertise

is invaluable
to the first contact task force

it will need to remain my task force

The ship and crew are my purview

diplomacy and delegates are yours

Sounds like progress

 BEEPS
 FEMALE All crew

prepare for departure

Ah All additional supplies
are loaded and secured Captain

 And the delegates
 SARU Uh settled in

I believe there is an Earth simile

something to do with herding cats

WHISPERS I can imagine

Commander Nilsson

The mycelial network thins

as it approaches the galactic barrier

so Commander Stamets expects us

to arrive about four lightyears away

Well warp from there

Thank you Commander Detmer
take us to safe distance

 Aye Captain
 Lieutenant Christopher

open a shipwide channel

Aye Captain

Channels open

Discovery delegates

when I was a child I like many of you

dreamed of going where
no one has gone before

None of us couldve imagined it would be

under these circumstances

with so much uncertainty
so much at stake

We dont know what well find

we dont know how well be received

Once we enter the galactic barrier

well be beyond comms
contact and on our own

Innumerable worlds are counting on us

to make first contact and ensure
Species TenC stops the DMA

before it can do any more harm

It wont be easy

But with this crew

with these leaders and delegates united

I know that well succeed

Black alert

ALARM SOUNDING

Lets fly

 

Godspeed Discovery

 

 

 

ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS

BURNHAM Not the view I was expecting

Where are we in relation
to the galactic barrier

It looks like were
nine lightyears away

Commander Stamets
you owe me five lightyears

This is going to put us behind schedule

Im sorry Captain
Weve never been out this far

Uh its not an exact science

I got us as close as I could

Can you update the delegates

Of course

Commander Detmer set a course
for the galactic barrier

The DMA will move soon
We dont have much time

 Maximum warp
 Aye Captain

Dr Culber if you are able

I would appreciate your assistance

in spreading the word that

Madam President

I was not aware that
you would be joining us

Our delegate did not arrive in time

It was decided that
NiVar must be represented

even if by its president

SARU I see

Do not let me delay you any further

You said something to her didnt you

Good for you

I would never have done so had
I known she would be joining us

That we would see each other
in meetings every single day

Oh beginnings can be messy
Thats all right

Ah I cannot envision

any situation more awkward than this

When I first met Paul

those blue eyes Im telling you

Anyway I thought Id totally blown it

I obsessed over every word

He was so brilliant and blunt

Anyhow its not just you

Insecurity is universal
and totally normal

Its okay

Oh it is helpful to realize

that I am not alone in being
made foolish by such feelings

I am grateful you shared

 So am I
 Now let us inform the delegates

They will want news of our delay
as soon as possible

BOOK You said we couldnt beam
up the programmable antimatter

I dont see any shield generators here

This friend of yours who
told you about this place

who was he exactly

Doesnt matter

PHASER WHIRRING

What the hell are you playing at

 What
 You think I dont know an Emerald Chain

work camp when I see one

 Its not what you think
 Then what is it

MALE OVER SPEAKER Attention cell breach

Attention cell breach

 What are you keeping from me
 Nothing

 Answer me
 Nothing

Listen to me The camp has been
out of commission for years

BOOK It was here wasnt it
Where you were held prisoner

Were not going anywhere
until you tell me

Yes it was here

Almost ten years ago

Youre interrupting my work

GUARD Osyraa wants
to fasttrack your design

Since you lost your last helper
shes giving you a new one

A real charmer that one

Impressive design

Its a dilithiumalternative
engine right

Theyve had me working on one too

But those equations
are for something else

I didnt ask for help

Well I didnt ask to be here
but lucky for you I am

Where am I supposed to sleep

This uh good spot

How long you been here

Id rather not engage
in personal conversation

Just work then Thats fine by me

BOOK The scientist friend you told me about

this was him

Oros

His name was Oros

We werent friends at first

But it was a relief to have
someone to talk to again

For both of us

You should rest

You cant work all day and all night

Im fine

What are you working on

Just running some numbers

Looks like galactic
properdistance equations

but theres a variable
youre using I dont recognize

I was alone in a cell

Had to pass the time somehow
I ran numbers too

A lot of time a lot of numbers

How long were you alone for

I lost track

Four five years

I used to talk to myself

Narrate the day

Just to hear words aloud you know

So youre out of practice
being with others

and respecting boundaries

LAUGHS

Yeah you could say that

Im sorry

I understand

I have a trick to fall asleep
Want to hear it

EXHALES Sure

I list the digits of the golden ratio

CHUCKLES Thats too easy

Fine every third digit Eight

Three

Eight

Nine

Four

Eight

Four

Six

Four

It took a year but eventually we became friends

Under Osyraa and the Chain
we were all we had

I know something about that

I figured you might

Lets get the antimatter
and get out of here

How much further

Its just beyond the trees

PHASER POWERS DOWN

Commander Detmer how soon until
we reach the galactic barrier

Coming out of warp now Captain

So thats the edge of the galaxy

Is it wrong that I think
thats pretty damn cool

Frontiers are always cool Mr Rhys

If only we could enjoy it

But we have a job to do

Doublecheck shield systems

and run a multiphasic scan
on the barrier itself

I want to know what were heading into

and how to get ourselves and
everyone out quickly and safely

 Lets get to it
 ALL Aye Captain

 Status report
 Shields are ready Captain

All other systems are nominal

 Mr Saru
 Well unfortunately

scans show that the density
of negative particles

in this sector are significantly
higher than predicted

 Meaning what
 Our shields may not hold as long as expected

even with the antimatter upgrades

 Commander Stamets
 Already on it Captain

And when this is all over

you should thank
Heisenberg instead of us

Noted Whats your suggestion

Vacuumstate fluctuations
are creating discrete bubbles

of protected space that pass through

the galactic barrier at random intervals

Spacial cells for
lack of a better term

If we can position Discovery
inside of one

we should be able to safely ride it

through to the other side of the barrier

Okay but I dont see
a lot of consistency

amongst the spacial cells

Neither do we Captain
 are too unstable

Yeah those are the ones
that are showing up gray scale

Negative energy isnt allowing them to reach equilibrium

and settle into a fixed spectrum emission

So the colorful ones are our best bet

Yeah should be

Zora found one nearby thats forming right now

Sending the coordinates

Commander Detmer plot a course

Lets get through the barrier
as fast as we can

Itll be bumpy

 Red alert
 ALARM SOUNDS

 BURNHAM GRUNTS
 Were inside the barrier

SARU You may notice a shift
in your visible spectra

BURNHAM No kidding

SARU It will return to normal
once we reach a cell

that is in equilibrium

Closing in on the spacial cell

Shields dropping to 

 
 Mr Saru

The cell is not yet large
enough to hold us Captain

 How much longer
 Approximately seconds

Sensors show gamma rays
from a radioactive burst

incoming in four seconds
six degrees off port

DETMER Adjusting course

GRUNTING

Shields down to  

Stand by Commander Detmer
Spacial cell ready in three

two one

 Now
 Take us in

DETMER Aye Captain

Holding steady

 SARU Ah
 Good work

Maintain position

Lets get shields repaired

Lets keep an eye
on cell stability in here

Captain A word

This is not an ideal time
Madam President

I received a classified message
as we entered the barrier

Marked urgent our eyes only
Its being decrypted now

BOOK You good

Yeah

WHIRRING

BOOK Its a ship You said
this place was abandoned

It was

Whoever it is theyre cloaked

Its a courier model
Must be here to scavenge

And if theyre flying that low
its not the first time

What if they found the antimatter

It was hidden the last time I checked

When was that

I come here every year

Why

 TARKA One
 OROS Two

 Six
 Three

Six SCOFFS

No Damn it Two

That one always trips me up

CHUCKLES

For someone who says
hes not hard on himself

youre pretty hard on yourself

ALARM SOUNDING

No

No No No PANTING

Its okay Its just someone
probably trying to escape

The last time

 the other engineer with me

 Itll be over soon
 His head

CRYING His head

Hey hey

Its all right Okay

Its all right Come on Its all right

Its all right

CRYING

ALARM STOPS

See

Its done

Youre okay

EXHALES

Why did you

You didnt have to do that

I never had a real friend before

You were right you know

About what

About the equations

The variable is for
multiverse positioning

I have a way out of here

There is no way out of here

Not with this

True

If one is traveling
within this universe

Youre working on
an interdimensional transporter

Ive been designing it for years

But the power required
to successfully target

a specific universe thats

This camp runs off of a massive
geothermal energy source

Combined with power from the
warp core that were building

it could be enough

Where would you go

Kayalise

It means something like home

My people say that Kayalise

is a place beyond suffering

Its long been part
of our cultural history

And out of all of
the possible universes

it is said to be the most peaceful

Ive been searching for it for years

and my calculations
prove that its real

That sounds like paradise

You could come with me

If you want

Come on Lets get this over with

President Rillak Captain Burnham

I hope this reaches you before
you move out of comms range

Im sorry to report that the DMA

has just moved to a new
harvesting location

in the Alpha Quadrant

Ive attached all data that we have

Based on its current trajectory

we expect debris hit
by the gravitational wave

to begin impacting NiVar and Earth

in the next few days

hours by our best estimation

Im sending ships to evacuate but

 Zora Can you restore the rest
 ZORA Im sorry Captain

its damaged beyond repair

We need to go back

We cant afford to do that Not now

We have to stay the course
We have to get to the TenC

 I need to tell my crew
 No




    

No News like this will spread
faster than we can control

Thisthis has to remain
classified until

Telling them is my prerogative

Assembling this delegation
was delicate work

Earth is home for so many of my crew

 They deserve to know
 THUDDING

SARU Captain we need you on the bridge immediately

We have stopped moving

Our spacial cell has drifted
into a cluster of others

Its like a traffic jam

 What can we do here
 DETMER Not much

I cant control the trajectory
of the cell were in

How long will this take to clear

It could be moments hours or weeks

In the meantime it would seem
we have no choice but to wait

 

BURNHAM Commander Stamets have you found a way

 to get us moving yet  STAMETS I think so

Another cells forming

Pretty far away but its near a current

If we can get there we can ride it out of the barrier

Well be out in no time

The faster the better Commander

ZORA Captain I dont think shields will hold long enough

 to get there
 No no no no They might

Yeah iif we

if we use the cells that are blocking us

and then move quickly through
them before they collapse

Moving through the unstable
cells will expose us

to negative energy and a lot of it

How long will our shields hold

Maybe five minutes at this point

Five minutes Captain

We dont have any other options

Engineering can you do anything
to buy us more time

Well if uh we continually recalibrate

to counter the fluctuating

Will it work Commander

Im

cautiously optimistic

Ish

Thatll have to do

Commander Detmer plot us a course

Aye Captain

Leaving our spatial cell now

This is where you were held

Home for nearly two years in the end

The programmable antimatter
used to be in the cabinets

Should be more than enough
for our shields

OPENING CABINET DOORS

Theres nothing in here

Theres a spot behind
the wall under the sand

We stole our own stash We hid it there

 To use in the transporter
 Yeah

You never finished it

No we did

Had to use it sooner than expected

The Chain was planning
to shut down the camp

TARKA GRUNTS

This was our only chance

WHIRS

TRILLING

Oros

Its a masterpiece

Couldnt have done this without you

You know that

Do you think we have enough power

Were drawing from the entire warp core

Itll work

Ready

Yeah

Lets go home

EXHALES

 POWERING DOWN
 No

No

Needs more energy

ALARM SOUNDING

BOOK What happened after that

You were right

I was the worst kind of asshle

I get it you know

Looking back can be hard

For years

I blamed my father for
negotiating with the Chain

But I realized maybe it
was easier to blame him

than to face the fact
that ultimately

 he was powerless to stop them

And he knew it

Thats part of what drives me I think

Refusing to be powerless like that

Look whatever happened here with Oros

it drives you

And if were going outside
of the galaxy together

I need to know who Im dealing with

GROANING PANTING

 YELLS
 GUARD Get the shuttle ready

 Were taking Oros with us
 TARKA No

GUARD Youre lucky
I havent shot you yet

You told us
his transporter wouldnt work

You said it never would

WEAKLY No stop Please

 Tarka
 GUARD Yeah

We knew you were working on something

Said wed let him go
if he found out what it was

Osyraa hates liars

GRUNTS

GRUNTING

PANTING

Im so sorry

I didnt know you back then

Im gonna get us out of here

 Come on Please

We got to go We have to go now

 The golden ratio okay

 I think theyre broken Im gonna

 slow you down too much
 I can carry you I can carry you

 Its okay
 YELLS

PANTING GROANING

PANTING I forgive you

I dont deserve that

I I would have done
anything for freedom

ALARMS SOUNDING

I will fix the transporter

I will find another way

We will go to Kayalise together

I believe it PANTING

But you must leave now

Please

Ill come back for you

I promise

ALARMS CONTINUE SOUNDING

TARKA I hid in a cave for a week

trying to find a way back in

One day there was this massive
power surge at the camp

I heard ships leaving

I went back The place was deserted

Oros was gone

But I found this

The golden ratio

His message to me

It was our symbol for Kayalise

Home

You think he made it

Hes brilliant

If anyone can do it its him

Ive never found
any record of Oros since

alive or dead

Nothing

Thats why you come here every year

Looking for another sign

Statistically anythings possible

So I built my own transporter

But trying to find
the power to make it work

its taken years

And the DMAs power source
should have more than enough

So thats it

Thats who youre dealing with

 

DETMER We just lost one of our forward emitters

 BURNHAM Ensign Tal  Making repairs now Captain

Commander Detmer how much longer

until we reach the target cell

Its dead ahead Few more minutes

Once we arrive the new
spacial cell should carry us out

of the galactic barrier within the hour

We will then be able to
proceed to first contact

Commander Owosekun
how are we doing on shields

 Down to four percent
 Engineering

STAMETS We might be able to buy another seconds

but thats it

 CHRISTOPHER Its not enough
 Hey

Weve got this A month from now

youll be back skiing in Zermatt

And where you gonna go

Astoria

On Earths Oregon Coast

Its heaven

Hawaii for me The beach

A mai tai Maybe Ill
take up snorkeling

Great Im coming with you

Im gonna hike the Pacific Crest Trail

Ive locked onto
the target cell Captain

Stamets well need those
seconds on shields right now

Ill do my best not to kll us

Always appreciated

Owosekun track our time

Detmer on your mark

Aye Captain

Here we go

GRUNTS

seconds

Fourteen

Thirteen

Twelve

Eleven

Ten

Nine

Eight Sev GRUNTS

Were in SHUDDERS

Six seconds to spare

EXHALES

Nothing like cutting it close huh

Great work Detmer

Great job everyone

Mr Saru lets get a team on repairs

You have the conn

Madam President

A word

ZORA Well done Commander

 You too Zora
 ADIRA I dont know

You were cutting it pretty close

I like living on the edge

Okay

Hey Um

About earlier with the captain um

I might have been a little

enthusiastic

Yes I

CHUCKLES I did think
that I might lose my lunch

And I had curry so

 CHUCKLES
 Its just I um

I know how hard its been for you

being apart from Gray

I was

trying to help

I know

IveIve been all right actually

I mean its different but its not

baddifferent

II get to tell Gray about
all this when I see him

You know

And were like leaving the galaxy

CHUCKLES So

Yeah I um

I probably worry a bit too much

Fair warning but um

I will always reach for you
if it seems youre hurting

My dad never did that for me

So uh

I might do it a little extra for you

Okay

I have been warned

I too was moved by hearing
what Earth means to them

but it does not change my belief

that this information
cannot be shared yet

With respect I think
something else is going on here

For both of us

What do you mean

Right now we can
control who knows what

And not much else

Mm

Its a hard place to be

CHUCKLES

Earth and NiVar are
the only homes Ive ever known

And what I am right now is angry

I am angry at this situation

Im angry at the DMA creators

whoever they may be

Im angry at Book

And at the possibility that we uh

 we could fail

Your mother

she hasnt returned
to NiVar yet has she

No

No thankfully shes
still with JVini on PJahr

My mothers family is on Earth

And my partner just started
a new research project

on Earths moon

I had no idea

I wish you had said something

Putting words to it wont help him

But it might help you

Were all we have out here
Madam President

We have to support each other

Thats what this crew has done
in the darkest of times

But to do that takes honesty

With ourselves and with everyone

Let me know where you land

 

I applied the programmable antimatter

to the shield generator

Were ready to go

You shouldnt blame yourself
for leaving him behind

Theres not a day goes by that I dont

I hope hes out there

and you get to see him again

Along the way well stop the
DMA and save billions of lives

Thats the definition of a winwin

Ill take it

Now lets get through the damn barrier

DETMER Captain I couldnt be happier to report

that were officially out of the galactic barrier

Out of the Milky Way

 and into extragalactic space
 APPLAUSE

Well done

All of you

Its weird to see so few stars

Space has never felt this empty

Or quiet

Not many people have gotten to see this

Well Captain should I set a course

for the TenC

We should address the ship first

Lieutenant Christopher open a channel

 TRILLING
 Channels open

Madam President

Discovery crew

esteemed delegates

we have faced and met

our first challenge of this mission

Thank you

For your bravery

your focus your strength

Unfortunately I have
some difficult news to share

We have received word
that the DMA has moved

It is now days away

from NiVar Titan

and Earth

To the many on board

with family friends and colleagues

now under direct threat I too

feel your pain in this moment

 

SOFT CHATTER

NDOYE Madam President

Madam President

SIGHS I am so deeply
sorry for this news

Could you sit with me a while

I would appreciate your company

I find you a

comforting presence

Of course

So thats the hyperfield

As much as our longrange
scans can show us

I think I preferred it
as a blob of radio waves

Yeah

There is a planet about
two lightyears away from it

Initial scans dont show
any signs of life

But given its proximity
Im having a team check it out

to see if theres anything there

that can help us with first contact

Good idea

Thank you for sharing the news

We could have told them together

Why did you want me to do it

In times of crisis people need to know

that their leaders are
not rattled by uncertainty

or overwhelming odds

They need to know that there is a plan

That theyll be okay

Youre their president

You can give them confidence

A sense of security

Youre my president too

Oh

Im grateful

we had the chance to

connect

before we approach Species TenC

If we cant communicate with each other

what chance do we have with them

Hmm

What do you think well find
when we get to the hyperfield

BURNHAM I have no idea

But we have to succeed

We have to
