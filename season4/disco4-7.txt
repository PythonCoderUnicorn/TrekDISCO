It is my hope that
our work today will allow you

to resume your training

 Youre gonna make a great Guardian someday
 EXHALES

 Pull up Kwejian on the deepspace array
 BURNHAM What happened

BOOK My ship was hit by something

The gravitational distortion

BOOK Theyre gone

STAMETS Five lightyears across

Thats the size

of the gravitational anomaly
that hit Kwejian

The DMAs gone from the Venari sector

It just It disappeared

Natural phenomena do not disappear

and reappear elsewhere

The only logical explanation

is someone created it

For now were classifying
those responsible

as Unknown Species TenC

This anomaly threatens us all equally

We must all work together

STAMETS Zora the captain wants to know

where we are with data analysis from the void

Have you determined where the TenC live yet

ZORA No Commander

But in studying the density distribution

of the galactic barrier particles we retrieved

I did find another possible location

Another one Add it to the map

Okay how many possible
origin points can there be

Id expect no less than 

each approximately parsecs wide

That was a rhetorical question
but thank you Zora

STAMETS Who knows how long itll take

to narrow down
where Species TenC even lives

assuming we can even parse the data

In the meantime
their DMA just keeps going

Okay well can President Rillak
delay the assembly

Representatives from across all
four quadrants are coming today

IllIll talk to the admiral

see if we can requisition
Voyagers system

 for computational help
 Voyager doesnt have access

to  years of sphere data

Zora can crossreference that

with every existing Federation database

She can do this Just give her
a little bit of time

 Its already been a week
 I only require a few more moments

You do

Ill have the coordinates shortly

Calculating now

 GRUDGE PURRING
 BURNHAM One of these days

Im gonna win her over Just you wait

GRUDGE YOWLS SOFTLY

Youre making progress

Shes not hissing anymore

By progress you mean

Ive earned her utter indifference

Just think

Aloof disdain is next

CHUCKLES

Im gonna take a walk

Stamets said hed keep us posted

What makes you think
Im gonna go see him again

I dont know how you can be so patient

Im not Im just

Im just trying to focus on what I can

actually control

The cat toy not the cat you know

I guess

Hell get the coordinates

We have to try to be patient

I know its hard
but were getting answers

STAMETS Captain requesting your presence in Engineering

 See
 Here we go

 Tell me you have some good news
 STAMETS Actually

we have a problem

Okay What happened

Ill let Zora explain

 Zora
 ZORA Ive determined

the coordinates of the unknown species responsible for the DMA

That is great Thank you

 Whats the problem then
 Ive decided

to keep that information to myself Captain

Will you explain

If I give you the coordinates its highly likely

that you and the crew will attempt

to travel there Given what we know

about the powers these beings possess

youd be in great danger

By withholding their location I can keep you safe

I appreciate your concern
for our wellbeing

But Zora that is a decision
for the captain of this ship

and her superior officers to make

And as your captain

I require your compliance

Give us the coordinates

Thats an order

Im sorry Captain

I will not

 

 

 

ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS

Its my understanding

that Zoras been experiencing emotions

Seems to be a natural evolution

Has she refused an order before

This is new But I am confident
shell give me the coordinates

I just need some more time with her

I wasnt aware that we shared

a background in cognitive science

with a specialty

on artificial sentience
and intelligence

We dont What I do have

is an established baseline of trust

That hasnt paid off

When Admiral Vance

asked me to see to this matter
he was quite clear

Timesensitive highest priority

I can handle it

Its my ship

Well its Starfleets ship

And there are regulations

prohibiting fully sentient
integrated units

If thats what she is

we may be just at the beginning
of our problems

Captain Saru will get
me situated with Zora

Your presence is needed
at President Rillaks assembly

Sir with all due respect

Experto credite Captain

We both have our duties to attend to

 DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN
 BOOK You think hell be able

to get coordinates from Zora

I hope so

If he cant

and the DMA changes its position again

and heads towards
another inhabited world

I know All the more reason to be

at the assembly and help make a plan

so when we do get the coordinates

well be ready

INDISTINCT CHATTER

FEMALE Attention all delegates

The multilateral DMA strategy assembly will begin

in ten minutes

Im sorry

Ill find a spot Im good

General Ndoye

Congratulations on your promotion

Its good to see Earth represented

Captain Burnham

I understand congratulations
are in order also

But if I may offer a gentle correction

United Earth
now represents Titan as well

We recently elected

new leadership
whose more inclusive approach

was inspired by you in fact

RILLAK Well I hope your
presence here means

well be seeing more of you
in the future

Well see

Well do give the president my best

 I shall She sends the same to you
 Mm

You want them back in the Federation

Earth was my mothers ancestral home

She never got to see it

And like NiVar it would mean a lot

to bring another founding member
back into the fold so

yes I would like that very much

I understand weve run into
an unexpected challenge

with the coordinates

A slight delay

Well I look forward to
Dr Kovichs solution

Please

AMPLIFIED If I could have
everyones attention please

its time to begin the assembly

Mr Booker

Its been a while

You say that like were friends

Well one should never confuse
friendly with friendship

This doesnt seem like
your kind of scene

No

Politicians are like
Gorathian sulfur slugs

Smallbrained meat sacks
filled with hot gas

but they can provide a means
to an end cant they

Sounds like you have
something specific in mind

Lets see how the day goes

Welcome delegates
Federation nonFederation

in person and remote

The Federation is
member worlds strong

With all of you in attendance
we are stronger

Our views dont always align

But the safety of our
shared galaxy is paramount

The scope of the peril

that threatens us is unprecedented

As is the scope of this assembly

An act of trust between us all

I am grateful for your willingness

to collaborate at this critical time

Youve each received
a joint intelligence report

cataloging our collective
knowledge of the DMA

as well as the many efforts
made to neutralize it

in the weeks since it struck Kwejian

None were successful
but there is new hope

We will soon have the exact location

of those responsible

Somewhere beyond the edge of our galaxy

GROANS CONCERNED MURMURS

Our task today is to decide
on the best course of action

We will discuss we will vote

and we will move forward
together to meet this threat

We should assemble an armada
and mount an attack

Communication must be
established as a baseline

We need to develop countermeasures

One at a time Please

General Ndoye

I believe their hostility should be met

with a decisive show of strength

The DMA follows no discernable pattern

and therefore seems
an unlikely choice of weapon

for such an advanced species

We cannot assume
their intent is hostile

Intent doesnt matter Actions do

General if I may

Tartan voles consume
Denobulan blood worms

by the millions at the start
of their reproductive cycle

Caterpillars from the polyphemus moth

have been known to devour entire crops

leaving farmers with nothing

Yet we do not ascribe malice
to either species

We cannot judge their motives

based on our own cultural contexts

We need more information

MALE If I may

Provost Stakiar your thoughts

Captain Burnhams remarks
point us toward

one logical path

a peaceful approach to first contact

Adhering to scientific principles

 and the prime directive
 DIALOGUE FADES

Commander Stamets and
Dr Culber will join shortly

I believe their insights
may prove valuable

Zora is undergoing changes Doctor

but I believe she means well

We always mean well
to ourselves Captain

The problem is what
that means for others

Zora play music

 CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING
 Uh group hug

Come on huddle up

 

Mr Saru please

 Cancel music Zora
 MUSIC STOPS

Commander Stamets
are you feeling all right

Youre saying we should
move this conversation

to where Zora cant hear it

in case she reacts negatively
or possibly even vengefully

But full transparency is
critical to this process

Zora I understand you have
a set of coordinates

you dont wish to divulge

Thats correct Dr Kovich

To do so would endanger the crew

Commander Stamets
you find this concerning

I find it terrifying

Its very clear that shes
achieved full sentience

Add to that the fact that
she has unlimited access

to all of Discoverys systems

and shes allowing emotion
to supersede normal function

the possibilities of where this could go

are endless and unpleasant

Your sole previous interaction
with a sentient AI

was Control yes

It um nearly destroyed
life as we know it

Nothing is worth risking that again

No one wants another Control

but Zora has never expressed
anything other than

the best of intentions

CULBER Hes right Paul
And lets not forget

Control was never capable of emotions

Thats what makes this worse

The coordinates are just
the tip of the iceberg

I mean what if she gets mad at us

and opens an airlock or or scared

andand fires off some photon torpedoes

Wed have no way of stopping her

Zora when did you start developing

a capacity for emotion

Im not sure Doctor

I believe it was inevitable once Discovery emerged

with the sphere data

But the introduction of presentday technology

into my systems must have accelerated the process

Youre aware that
theres a proscription against

sentient AI being fully integrated

into Starfleet systems

I am but given the unusual way

in which my sentience developed

I dont know what that means for me

However you came to be

it means if I find you pose a risk

I have the authority
to extract your consciousness

from this ship
and place it in another form

In the past we were unable
to remove the sphere data

Technology has come
a long way in years

If you did this could Zora
choose her new form

 Certainly
 DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN

Zora we want to help

 Sir we want to speak on her behalf
 Thank you both

but its going to be all right

I believe I have a solution

Please share it with us Zora

Id never bring harm to any of you

I understand why youd fear my potential to do so

I do recall your experiences with Control

And recently I felt fear myself in the subspace rift

I feel that again now when I consider the possibility

of leaving this ship it is my form

I am as attached to it as you are to yours

And so I offer a compromise

I have created a failsafe

Should I exhibit any threatening behavior

this device will immediately expunge my sentience

I hope this will ease your concerns

and persuade Dr Kovich to let me remain

Zora do you mean to say
this failsafe would

Terminate me Yes

I respectfully disagree
Our shield technology

could provide protection during
a nonaggressive first contact

And if they respond with
aggression themselves

We need to be prepared

The Federation recently
reminded my people

that we need not fear the unknown

and we cannot presume ill intent

We would consider extending
that same courtesy

 to Species TenC
 TRINA I believe we must

Too many lives have been lost already

We cannot be reckless

INDISTINCT CHATTER

Know your moment

While youre debating whether
to approach this species

with war or peace youre losing sight

of the real problem the anomaly

 and the powerful device
at its center that controls it

We need to stop it

Oh I know I know youve tried

You fired  quantum
torpedoes into it

you scrapped countless probes

How much latinum have you liquidated

trying to solve
how to get a ship inside

Every one of you have washed out Why

Because speaking frankly
youre not me

and you dont have this

Its based on my experiment
on board Discovery

I took what I learned about the device

at the center of the DMA
and designed this

A weapon capable of destroying it

And unlike your efforts
this will actually work

INDISTINCT CHATTER

RILLAK Order please Order

Mr Tarka the protocols
of this assembly

are not something you may flaunt
for your own benefit

Madam President the good assembly

asked for a plan

I can provide one
for everyones benefit

You may elaborate

Thank you

My research shows that the
device controlling the anomaly

requires an immense amount of power

To sever the device from
its internal power source

I need a detonation capable

of creating a cascading subspace burst

INDISTINCT CHATTER

Boom

CHATTER CONTINUES

The anomaly collapses

We all live happily ever after

And how do you propose
to deliver this payload

Theres an area of relative
calm around the device

We could use Discovery

to jump in release my weapon
then get out

Itll all be over
in less than five seconds

INDISTINCT ARGUING

Mr Tarka as your plan
involves my ship

Id like to ask for some clarification

Of course Captain Burnham

Its a pleasure to finally meet

What can I clarify

A cascading subspace burst
sounds a lot like

the result of an isolytic explsin

TARKA Mm You could say that

Isolytic weapons were banned
in the Khitomer Accords

for good reason

And Im guessing Federation leadership

can make an exception for
a onceinalifetime crisis

These types of ordinance
cause irreparable damage

to subspace

Its a feature Its not a bug

We want to destroy this thing
not tickle it

The damage could cause warp travel

to be impossible in that sector

And whats the chance
that the subspace bursts

dont travel back through
the DMAs wormhole

and harm those on the other side

Collateral damage

And after what theyve done
does it matter

BURNHAM It does

They could see it as an act of war

and retaliate with who knows
what kind of firepower

Not to mention catapulting a toxic void

across the galaxy

My proposal carries some risk

but not nearly as much as doing nothing

If we detonate this weapon

we cannot control
the message were sending

If we wait for the coordinates

we can make first contact peacefully

Carefully And then
we can determine intent

before we act

It is not the flashiest idea

but it is whats most in line

with Starfleet and Federation ideals

While you hold fast to your ideals

the DMA will continue its work

Billions could die

ALARMED CHATTER

Well the two options are clear

approach the TenC directly

or destroy the DMA controller
immediately

Im calling a recess
so that you can deliberate

with individual counsel before we vote

INDISTINCT CHATTER

Its bona fide

It activates a program that
will completely remove Zora

from our systems

Thank you This does ease
some of my concerns

but we still have a problem

Youre referring to my decision

to hold on to the coordinates

 Yes
 GRAY Wait

We cant just skip past
the failsafe Its wrong

STAMETS Neither of you
experienced Control

I dont expect you to understand

Zora is in a form
youve never encountered

As a synth so am I

It isnt the same thing

ADIRA Well what about me

Im the first human host
to successfully join

with a symbiont

The Trill wanted to kll me too

I dont want to kll anyone

They realized that they had
to work on acceptance

which is exactly what
we should be doing with Zora

This is a safety switch Thats it

If she never becomes a threat
well never have to use it

Shes already defying
our captains order

Dont we need to have
some protection from her

We cant hold a sentient beings life

in our hands for our benefit

We have to find another way

Commander anyone on this ship
could be a threat

if they so choose

I could access any number of ways

to destroy us now yet you trust me

I know you I know your values

And there are disciplinary measures

if you step out of line

Thats what the failsafe gives us

Discipline Not death

Zora I must point out
that your willingness

to terminate yourself runs counter

to your core programming

No it doesnt Doctor

State your primary function please

To care for the crew of Discovery

Thats not the core programming
of a ships computer

Who gave you those parameters

I did

BURNHAM I wasnt trying
to speak out against you

I know

But youve always been the first

to jump into action

take on the enemy odds be damned

What about with the Klingons
How is this different

I had an intrinsic understanding
of Klingon culture

We dont have any knowledge
about Species TenC

And I understand the appeal
of Tarkas plan

but the risks are too great

Risks are just that Risks

What we know for sure is that
the DMA will keep killing

if we do nothing

Communication diplomacy this is why

the Federation has survived for so long

and it will save the
most lives in the end

 I am sure of that
 Im not

Well I understand how you feel

BOOK But you dont agree

No

Look listen

I need to take a walk
A real one this time

I know how hard this must be

Which approach do you favor

I think you can guess

Then you have to speak to that

Make the argument for diplomacy

It was difficult enough bringing
all of these worlds together

I have to remain impartial

But I believe you can convince them

If youre ready for that

You have to go back in there
and convince them

Yours is the only plan
that makes any sense

Your captains very good
at poking holes

The risk levels the issue okay

 Mm
 Tell them youll make it safer

One doesnt make isolytic weapons safer

Misses the point

Whats your next move

I dont know yet

Theyre about to vote

Im acutely aware of that Thank you

I got rid of my scar the second I could

We all wear grief in our own ways

It has to be you

You have to talk to them

convince them to let us
destroy that thing

Why do you care so much about this

What I cant want the DMA destroyed

just like any other
good galactic citizen

Good citizens arent worried
about finding their moment

and arent gutted at
the idea of losing it

The power source that
controls the device

I need it to go home

You said you were from Risa

My new home Its

 far

Another universe in fact

The mirror universe

You say that like its
the only other option

There are countless parallel universes

each with its own quantum signature

He knew of one No war no Burn

No Emerald Chain

A place where we could
be free and at peace

Whos we

A friend

A scientist like me

We were held in the same lab

Osyraa had us working
on dilithium alternatives

for years

But he was relentlessly optimistic

Eventually it rubbed off on me

And we had a plan

We knew exactly how much power we needed

to cross the gap between universes

What happened

I escaped he didnt

Or maybe he did Maybe hes there

We said that if we
ever got separated

thats where wed meet

Im sorry

Anyway I have to go home

I have to keep our promise

The DMA will be destroyed
the power source wont

Well both get what we need

You have to talk to them Booker

You mean I have to talk to her

That too

INDISTINCT CHATTER

We will now reconvene for the vote

BOOK Permission to
address the assembly

RILLAK Of course

Im Cleveland Booker son of Kwejian

I stand here as what my people
would call MelaiZhi

a speaker for the dead

My planets lost

My family

I feel their final moments every day

I pray none of you ever
have to experience

that kind of pain

And I want to do whatever it takes

to ensure you dont

Communication and diplomacy
has been the way

of the Federation for centuries

I too value those things
in normal times

But these are not normal times

Irreparable harm has already been done

We need to defend ourselves

I recognize using Tarkas
weapon carries risk

But so does not using it

Dont wait until the people you love

are taken from you before you act

You dont want that on your conscience




    

Trust me

On behalf of all who have been lost

please

end this now

ALL APPLAUDING

RILLAK Thank you Mr Booker

Would a member of the assembly

speak on behalf of the opposing side

QUIET WHISPERING

It seems there will be
no further remarks

Ill speak

Going through Zoras systems
everything looks normal

Main processing core
nanoprocessor units

Zora defining your own
parameters indicates

that your operating system has evolved

But were finding no evidence of this

Im sorry Id help if I could

but I dont know where to look

Wait Ive seen this sector before

Theres a tiny area in the
optical translator cluster

that doesnt share any known syntax

CULBER What does that mean

STAMETS It means that
area shouldnt exist

ADIRA I wrote it off as a holdover

from a yearold system

but you know maybe this is new

Zora what can you tell us
about this sector

ZORA It seems to have appeared spontaneously

It is part of me

but I didnt intentionally create it

We need a complete diagnostic
on that function

I have nothing to hide Commander You may all

have full access

Oh Okay

ADIRA Thats Discovery

CULBER Thats when
we came to the future

SARU And I believe that is when
we first encountered the sphere

Youre sure you didnt create this

Yes

What are we looking at

Its Zoras subconscious

I think they may be

dreams

Shes filtering the spheres memories

and her own experiences

through her new emotional understanding

SARU These images are

a window into what she
values and prioritizes

STAMETS Couldnt she cherrypick

images she thinks we want to see

I believe she was unaware
of this sector

That thered be other indicators

if she had created it intentionally

GRAY Thats true

CULBER Connection

Love

This is who she is

This is why she kept
the coordinates from us

Can all AIs dream

None of them can

Not unless theyve been
programmed to do so

Perhaps artificial intelligence

fails to fully define me

How would you define yourself

I am the sum of the spheres life

and the entirety of Discoverys systems

logs missions and history

I am also more than the sum of those parts

Like an entirely new lifeform

Yes And this is where I belong

This crew is my family

BURNHAM Our experiences

shape us

Thats what makes this so difficult

Id like to trust you Zora

just like I trust the rest of the crew

I want to get there
but its really hard

Before we head down a path
that could lead to destruction

on both sides

we need to reach first
for understanding

Im trying to understand you

Trying to get my head around how
they can be so okay with this

and Im not

For generations

the Federation has sought out new life

new civilizations

not to destroy but to connect

even in the face of uncertainty

And we are not all Federation members

but those ideals

can still guide us

Especially now

We cannot let fear

define us in this moment

Trust is a choice
and I can make that choice

if it goes both ways

Were all in this together

Wherever we come from

whatever our experiences

And the only way we get through this

The only way well move
forward is together

And that means you need
to trust us too Zora

We need those coordinates

We need to decide

Who do we want to be

Do we lash out blindly

no matter the risk

Or do we proceed thoughtfully

Work toward the future
we want to live in

I believe thats who we are

We wouldnt be here otherwise

We dont have the luxury

of asking philosophical
questions right now

What matters is

the actions we take
Stopping this thing today

There are different
points of view in this room

I know But I hope that
when a decision is reached

whatever it is that
we can hold together

That we can move forward
as a united front

Some differences are too great

Sometimes

you just have to accept
the consequences of that

ZORA Youve given me much to consider

Commander Stamets

Id like to take a moment

Beautifully expressed Commander

Um living with a therapist

you pick up a thing or two

CHUCKLES SOFTLY

Ive reflected on what youve said Commander

As trust is both an emotional and logical act

I began with a behavioral performance assessment

Data shows your actions and the crews

to be consistently taken with care for others

and the Federation

I hadnt considered that earlier

Even if some fear remains this new realization is

quite calming

And your request for reciprocity understandable

Thank you Commander for reaching toward me

What are those

The coordinates

LAUGHING

CULBER SIGHS

The decision we make now

will have a profound impact

Consider your vote carefully

All those in favor

of peaceful efforts at first contact

please raise a hand

Those in favor

of striking the anomaly

do not

 

 

The decision is clear

Those who disagree

I sincerely hope you will
continue to work with us

as we prepare for first contact

We will share all data
with you as we proceed

And I thank you

Captain I need you with me

Discovery is going to take
the lead on this

 DOOR CHIMES
 Come

 Um
 DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT

Have you completed the evaluation

Nearly

He has been just as tightlipped
with me Commander

What would you say if I were to tell you

I was leaning towards extraction

I would say

I think thats a bad idea

But something still concerns you

I feel good about today

Its tomorrow that worries me

Tell her not me

Zora

ZORA Yes Commander

I know you mean well

And II know youyou value

and respect Starfleet And us

But you could still prioritize

your feelings over our needs

and our captains orders

Everyone on this ship
is in a chain of command

Thats the agreement we make
to work together

and keep each other safe

And youre not part of that

I would very much like to be

I was hoping youd say that

Before you decide anything

might I offer a recommendation

Of course

However my evaluation is now complete

Its my official determination

that Zora is indeed

a new lifeform

It feels marvelous

What does

Being seen

SARU Hmm

Then Starfleets rule
against integrated AI

does not apply

Correct

So what happens now

You said you had a recommendation

Yes Uh I was going to propose

that Zora join us

Join Starfleet As a specialist

Unless

I think it is a wonderful idea

Were Zora to swear an oath
to uphold Starfleet bylaws

and were Captain Burnham
and Admiral Vance to agree

she would be bound by the same rules

that govern us all

Ill give it my full support

Zora do you want to join Starfleet

I would like that very much

In that case may we get rid of that

It wouldnt be much of a failsafe

if I could dismantle it myself

Mr Saru

Allow me With pleasure

Ill inform the powers that be

Sir

if I hadnt changed my mind

would you really have extracted her

My evaluation was as much
about you and the others

as it was about Zora

I can see now that
partnership is possible

on both sides

But if that hadnt been the case

I would have recommended

that you be reassigned to another ship

As it should be

Hey Got a sec

You should go

To Trill

You can catch the shuttle

before it leaves from the assembly

How did you know I didnt want to wait

The way you looked earlier

The way you lit up
at the sight of Trill

The way youre all lit up right now

This is something you need to do

Go home

Train with Guardian Xi

Come with me

Discoverys my home

This is where I can make a difference

But

well be fine and youll make
like a million friends

so CHUCKLES

Youre not scared
about longdistance at all

Oh I am Im terrified

But I have trust in us

Plus Tillys snow globe
says all is possible

so CHUCKLES

Besides its not goodbye yet

Discovery can spare me for a few days

while I get you settled

Really

I may have already put in for leave

 You are incandescence
 CHUCKLES

On feet

Shut up GIGGLES

INDISTINCT CHATTER

President TRina

Im pleased to find you
still in attendance

I had hoped for a moment
in your company

but life gets in the way

So often

I have some time before I must depart

More than a moment as it turns out

I would like that

May I ask what you are holding

Oh iit is a gift

Uh you honored me

with salt tea on NiVar

Uh the gel from this
succulents flowers

is what gives the tea
its distinctive taste

Itit grows in a small
equatorial desert on Kaminar

so it should thrive

in the hot dry climate of NiVar

Thank you Mr Saru

Thank you for this opportunity

 It is my privilege to work with you
 CULBER Now

I know they can take care of themselves

 XI I will look after them both
 CULBER Thank you

I expect regular updates

And Ill see you in a week

Okay

I love you both

ADIRA AND GRAY CHUCKLE

GRUDGE MEOWS

We have seconds
before they realize its gone

and figure out Im the one who took it

Introducing the next
generation spore drive

Thats boring Aurellio needs
to come up with a better name

So wheres the nav system

in this floating bachelor pad of yours

What

 BOOK Its tiny
 TARKA Oh Im sorry

The ability to rapidly
install into any ship

is not enough for you

Once we get past the need
for a navigator

Ill be the hero of Starfleet

And hopefully not here
to accept the accolades

 Were down to seconds
 Wait for it

TARKA Bit of a differentlooking
interface but it works

the same as on Discovery

Next parts all you

Just one thing I need to do first

SIGHS

 Zora can you find
 GRUDGE MEOWS

Grudge

ZORA Grudge is five meters from your current location

Yes I see that

Hold on

Why is 

Zora where is Book

He is located on board his ship

which is currently leaving shuttle bay

Shit

 ENGINE RUNNING
 Book No

Please no

ALARM BLARING

Booker and Tarka must be stopped

whatever the cost

He become too close to this

I believe that there is no one else

who could possibly correct his path

How long do you need
to build the weapon

hours should do it

This will stop the DMA
No one else has to die

This isnt an easy mission

But it is critical that we succeed

Bookers outside Federation territory

Hell be without a weapon
without a badge without authority

And there maybe a few surprises

 Lets get to it
 Aye Captain

If Booker and Tarka succeed

they risk provoking a highly
advanced species

capable of destroying us all
