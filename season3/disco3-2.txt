Previously
on Star Trek: Discovery...

Attention, all vessels.

Leland's fleet has arrived.

Control will not stop coming.

Eventually, Leland

will find you.

Last warning.

Transmit the data to me

or you'll be destroyed.

The Sphere's data has already
merged with Discovery.

As long as Discovery exists
here and now,

this will never be over.

Discovery has to go
to the future.

Commander Burnham
will use the suit

to open a wormhole.

Discovery will be
on autopilot behind her.

We're here
because we're staying with you.

But I don't know
what the future holds.

It is done, Michael,

and we are running out of time.

The housing is prepped.

I need that last panel.

Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.

Paul, your injuries are,
are pretty severe.

I'm going to induce coma.

You'll be fine.

This does not end here.

Actually, it does.

No!

Commander Burnham, on your mark.

Burnham to Discovery.

Let's go.

Lieutenant Detmer, full power.
Follow our signal.

Back to stations!

Lieutenant Detmer!

Everyone, everyone,
back to stations now!

Short-range sensors
to maximum...

Feels like my head is in a vice.

Tidal forces from the wormhole.

Like g-forces but nastier.

Must've knocked us all out.

Including my damn back.

Commander, I can't get control!

Shields are collapsing!

Injuries on multiple decks!

Sensors are not responding, sir!

Critical systems failing!

- Detmer.
- Sir,

Discovery is unresponsive.

Rerouting to gain control.

Brace!

Brace! Brace!

We'll disintegrate in 15 seconds
at current velocity.

I've got minimal controls
back on line, sir.

Recommendation, Lieutenant?

A thermal roll.

Let the top of the shields
take some of the brunt.

Quickly, please.

Go hard.

A glacier?

I need the spot with the highest
thickness and density levels.

- On it.
- Ready the graviton beam.

Activate deflector shields
in bursts

to cushion our landing.
On my mark.

- Yes, Commander.
- Aye, Commander.

At five degrees from port side,
uh, ice is 50 meters thick.

- Copy.
- Is that deep enough?

We're gonna find out.

This is Commander Saru.

All decks prepare for impact.

Rhys, fire now.

Deflector shields are off-line!

Hold us steady, Lieutenant!

- All right, Detmer!
- Detmer!

Way to go, Detmer!

All right, Detmer!

Well done, Lieutenant Detmer.

Someone buy that woman a drink.

And a neuroblocker for me.

Keyla?

Yeah.

We made it.

We're good.

You need to go to sickbay.

Uh, no, it's nothing.

Your comrade is correct,
Lieutenant.

Get to sickbay.

Yes, sir.

Status reports?

Tactical systems are down.

As are long-range comms

and all inship communications,
Commander.

Sensors are not responding.

We don't know where we are,

and we don't know when we are,
sir.

My back might be
short-circuiting

my brain right now,

but I don't recall Terralysium
being particularly icy.

Can you speculate on the cause
of the systems outage?

Based on how hard we hit,

probably
a plasma manifold rupture.

We'll have to find and fix
all the blown

EPS relays and conduits
on the ship

before we can go anywhere.

We can't fly.

We can't call for help.

We can't call Michael.

She's alone.

We are completely disconnected

at present, yes.

But...

we are also together.

And alive.

If Commander Burnham
landed elsewhere,

I trust she is aware
that we will find her

as soon as we are able.

Begin a search for the affected
relays and conduits.

Inform all you come
in contact with to do the same.

Crew members are to work
in pairs until

internal communications
are reestablished.

Commander, we can't locate

the problems
without internal sensors.

I can modify the tricorders,

like I did on the Hiawatha.

I will survey the damage
in person.

And...

I am aware

that you all may feel

an expedited need
to see and understand

what is out there.

But our first priority
is in here.

The integrity of this ship
and this crew.

Am I clear?

Aye, sir.

Lieutenant Rhys,
you have the conn.

Ensign, with me.

Coming through on your right.

It's, uh...

It's odd.

Uh, there are, um...
Excuse me... large pockets,

uh, on the surface where
the atmosphere has higher levels

of oxygen
than the rest of the planet.

Is there any discernible
pattern? A design?

Yes, sir.

Ea-Each pocket
is essentially a-a decagon,

which would in-indicate to me
that someone made them.

I don't know, but it's
the only explanation.

Then we are not on Terralysium.

No, sir.

Um, but there is evidence
of an active settlement

within one of these pockets,
so there...

...there's life.

There is... life.

How long for repairs,
Mr. Bryce?

Well, it's not a repair, sir.

For this particular transtator,
it's...

a complete rebuild.

Six hours, minimum,

assuming we have
enough rubindium.

So, no communications
until then.

Um, you have some, uh,

Leland on your shoes.

Somebody had to make sure
he was dead.

Someone else needs
to clean the spore cube.

There's gooey bits of him
everywhere. You.

Did I hear you say we still have
no communications?

Uh...

He will complete repairs as soon
as he is able, Commander.

All available hands are busy
repairing the EPS grid.

Do you require
medical attention?

Of course not.
We can spare one engineer.

Uh... I have no desire to leave
Commander Burnham on her own,

but we must get all systems
up and running

as quickly as possible.

Wherever we have arrived,

we are strangers.

We cannot assume
that we are welcome.

- Carry on, Mr. Bryce.
- Yes, sir.

Oh.

Commander, uh, sorry, excuse me.

Paul? Paul?

I know. I know.

Dr. Pollard!

Biobed.

I'm going to induce coma.

You'll be fine.

Where...

Can you hear me?

Hmm?

Follow my fingers.

Good. Good.

- We made it through.
- Mm.

But it was
a pretty rough landing.

And I wouldn't have brought you
out so soon,

but there are some people
in really bad shape.

We need your biobed.

Worse than me?

Yeah.

Wh...
When are we?

We don't know when we are.

Sensors are down.

- Comms are down.
- What?

Soon as I have an answer,
I'll let you know, okay?

I'm gonna take you to the
cellular regeneration chamber,

and you should be good
in a few days.

- I'm good now.
- No.

No, you're not.

- Take it slow.
- Mm.

The-the... the plasma manifold.

- The EPS grid is...?
- It's being handled.

They'll need
all the help they can get.

I'll tell you what.
I'll let you go to work

if you can spell
"My Partner Brought Me Out

of a Coma and All I Got
Was This Lousy T-Shirt."

Spell it.

My brain...

Yes, it's scrambled like an egg.

Come on. Slow.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

L-O-U-S-Y

T-S-H-I-R-T.

"T-shirt" has a hyphen.

Cellular regeneration
is the only way

we're gonna get you even
moderately functional today.

One full cycle, minimum.

Five cycles if you want
to finish healing that scar.

Ow! Are you punishing me?

Yes. And I love you.

And that was a neuroblocker
to help

with the pain,
so you're welcome.

And if you don't stay in
for a full cycle

before doing anything else,
I'll have Saru ground you.

- Understood?
- Understood.

It's good to have you back.

It's good to have you alive.

Mm-hmm. All right.

He didn't make it?

No.

Your neurological tests
are clear, no concussion.

You're good to go.

What?

I said you're good to go.

Is there something else?

No.

Thanks.

Why is this here? Shouldn't

what's-his-name
be building the new assembly?

We don't have enough rubindium
on board.

No transtator means
no communication.

Not within this ship,
not outside of this ship,

and not to Michael,
wherever she is.

Scans show that the settlement

has a natural supply
of rubindium,

as well
as several other minerals,

most of which
I can't even begin to identify.

Looks like
the future has brought us

an entirely new elemental table.

I think
there's enough able-bodied

to pull together a recon team.

Are there other relevant details
you've gathered thus far?

Not much.

Um, I have a lot of information
about this planet,

but I don't know
which planet we're on.

This is like reading an obituary
backwards.

The settlement only has 50
life signs, but they have ships

whose design would presume
warp capability, but...

I haven't gotten
any dilithium readings.

So they couldn't
possibly fly them.

I don't understand, but, um,

they have warp, and they have
ships, so that's, uh...

that's one... c-common, um...

mutual, uh...

Should we get
the Command Training Manual,

or can you find your own way
to making a point?

- Commander.
- We need to fix communications,

and time is of the essence.

We are all
acutely aware of that.

We will acquire what we need
to repair our transtator

as quickly as possible,
and we will reveal as little

of ourselves as possible

- in the process.
- They have

an artificial atmosphere, Saru.

These are not Kelpiens
who have never seen a starship.

They have 930 years

on us. Why hide from them?

Assuming we arrived
in the correct time,

we carry with us a knowledge

of certain past events
that we cannot share,

lest we impact the present

or future of any society
with which we interact.

Whether or not
the local population

is more or less advanced

is immaterial.

We will adhere
to their cultural standards.

We will barter peacefully.

We crash-landed,
and we're going in blind.

The chances
that they greet us peacefully

are preposterously low.

We will not abandon
what we believe.

If this were my planet,

I'd already have us surrounded,
weapons drawn.

I am not asking you
to participate, Commander.

I am telling you
what we will do in your absence.

Ensign Tilly, you will join me.

- Me?
- Her?

- I'm sorry.
- Are you trying

to get us all slaughtered?

She has as much
psychic dominance as a kitten.

- Okay, what the f...!
- Uh.

- Uh...
- Report to sickbay.

We will have Dr. Pollard
administer appropriate treatment

so that we may breathe naturally
in this atmosphere.

Commander Nhan, I am placing you
in charge of the ship's repairs.

And I need you to assist
in the repair of the EPS grid.

If we cannot fly
to Commander Burnham's location,

we are of no use to her.

You are dismissed!

How many drugs
are you on right now?

I'm just...
moving a little slowly.

As a person
in great pain would move.

Uh, as I know all too well.

Let me take a wild guess.
You didn't find what

you were looking for,
and are now wondering

if maybe the problem's
in the Jefferies tubes?

Why are you talking to me as if
we're working on this together?

Because that's exactly
what's happening.

Absolutely not.

Saru wants us working on teams.

And apparently, if you can
breathe, you can work.

So, unless Hazmat over here
is gonna be helping

after he cleans up aisle five...

My-my name's Gene, actually.

- I've already forgotten that.
- I don't need...

I've already determined the
location of the ruptured relay.

Great. Let's go.

That wasn't an invitation.

- I can do this on my own.
- Fine. Then I'll just

follow you
for the witty repartee.

Nobody's ever been here before.

No one's ever... had to say
what this is like or, uh,

what this feels like.

It's just...
It's so weird. Just...

I mean,
there's a giant hunk of planet

hanging there in the sky.

I wish we had the time to figure
out how all this works.

Sorry, sir. I'm-I'm talking
because I'm scared.

I know.

Keep talking, Ensign.

You know, on the ship, I said

the scans were, uh, odd
or, uh, strange?

But it's not true.
It's that...

we're odd and strange.

Well, not to each other.

Thank you for asking me
to accompany you, sir.

Why did you ask me
to accompany you, sir?

I needed an engineer.

The ship's full of engineers.

Georgiou's an engineer.

An engineer I can trust.

She thinks I'm useless.

She's concerned for Michael

and lacks the self-awareness

to control her behavior
in such an unsettled state.

We are introducing ourselves
to the future.

You, Ensign Tilly,

are a wonderful
first impression.

First contact.

It's parasitic ice of some kind.

Nilsson and her team are trying
to figure it out.

So far, we know
it accelerates in the shade,

so when the sun goes down,
we're screwed.

All the more reason
to get off this piece of rock

before we're entombed
like woolly mammoths.

Oh, that's a fun new sound.

All relays and conduits
are clear on Deck Four.

We could use some help
on Deck Eight.

What the hell
are you doing here,

besides saving their asses?

Saving your ass.
You're welcome.

I don't do gratitude.

You could have stayed
on the Enterprise

and remained in the time
you were meant to be in,

if you believe in that kind
of thing, which I don't.

I stayed for Airiam.

She was a science officer, but
she paid the price of a soldier.

I felt like
somebody should honor that.

- A life for a life, you know?
- I do.

What an unbelievably
shitty decision.

Says the woman who's still here.

Section 31 would have begged me
to take over sooner or later,

and bureaucracy is
where fun goes to die.

I like jumping
from universe to universe.

Commander?

The EPS grid is functional
on Deck Six.

Hello, Georgiou.

You must have
an enormous visible spectrum.

Hmm. 74,000 nanometers.

We should talk.

Report to Deck Eight, Linus.
They could use help.

I'll join him.

See you later.

Those are blast marks
on those rigs.

Somebody wanted
to shut this place down.

- So it would appear.
- Not to state the obvious, sir,

but it occurs to me that
the somebody we're following

could be the same somebody
who wanted

to shut this place down.

It could be
a different somebody,

but if it's not,
then we would be walking into,

um, a, a trap... maybe?

I would never expect any
of my crew to not have fear.

But I will ask you
to contain it now.

Are you with me, Ensign?

Hundred percent, sir.

Shit.

Greetings.

We mean no harm.
Our ship crashed.

A Starfleet ship. We know.

So much
for not giving ourselves away.

Who are you?
What do you want?

I am Saru.

This is Tilly.

My name lacks authority.

- What?
- What?

We are officers of Starfleet.

- Prove it.
- You...

have already identified
our ship.

Anyone could be flying
that ship.

Starfleet Regulation 256.15:

"Officers shall display

behavior befitting
an officer at all times."

Which is why we're not

freaking out right not
about being held at phaser point

by a bunch of strangers.

It's actually really scary, so

could you please
lower your weapons or...

I don't know, tell us your name,

so one of those things
isn't true.

My name is Kal.

I told you.

They can't help us, Kal.

Yes, they can.

And they will.

It's a-a part of them.

How they are.

Uh, friends,

our navigation system
is damaged.

What planet are we on?

It's never had a proper name.

We call our home The Colony.

We're miners,
many of us Coridan.

Please, Kal...

Zareh will have
tracked them here.

- I know.
- Who is Zareh?

Can your ship fly?

Do you have a weapons system?

We are a science vessel.

A piece of our communications

- equipment is damaged.
- Kal...

they have to go.

Who is Zareh?

We have dilithium.

We do, we can, we can help you.

We can help each other.

I told you.

How much dilithium?

Sufficient to power
your vessels.

We need more... and extra
to sell at the Exchange.

And we have to fix
our equipment as well.

I am confident that we can
come to an agreement.

Give it to me.

We have to hurry.

The blown relay can be accessed
via the junction point

five meters up.

And then it's located
11 meters in.

- Should be an easy fix.
- Great.

Let me know if you need
any help.

I need you

to access the blown relay.

Sorry, sunshine,
the spine says no.

So, what, you're just
gonna sit there?

I'm offering moral support.

And you're in great shape,
right?

I mean, for two hours
I've just heard about

how pain is not
in your vocabulary.

Uh, fine.

I'm...

- experiencing some discomfort.
- Yeah.

You were impaled
by a seven-inch shard

of duranium alloy

and put in a coma.

Helpless is a shitty feeling.

But it is not forever,

and it doesn't make you
any less capable.

Do us both a favor,

and just admit that you're
not bringing your A game.

Let's get Nilsson up there.

I'm sure she could do it.

No.

I'm good.

I've got this.

I have never seen
anything like this.

How old is your starship?

Oh, we like to think of her
as a classic, so...

This is your repair kit?

Uh...

Whoa.

I've never seen
rubindium do that.

This is programmable matter.

Yeah, no, no, I know.

That was a quiz.

You passed.

Luckily, my repair database

has equipment
with similar functionality

to your transtator.

Otherwise,
I couldn't have helped.

Can't bake a peach pie
with a gazpacho recipe, right?

Oh, that's something
my grandma used to say.

You're really adept at that.

Wow.

Maybe I'm Starfleet material.

I just always believed
you would come.

And you did.

So...

- Been a long time, huh?
- Yeah.

But once we're
self-sufficient again,

we can defend ourselves.

Why did nobody try until now?

My brothers tried.

Might I inquire as to why

- this Zareh inspires such fear?
- Might I inquire

how you managed to avoid finding
that out for yourself?

As I said, we have been
adrift for quite some time.

Yeah, well, you should
have stayed adrift.

You're just gonna
make things worse.

Zareh's our courier.

He delivers what
we can't make or grow.

Which is pretty much everything.

And you have no dilithium

to gather what you need
for yourselves.

How long has he exploited
your community?

Since he blasted our equipment,

decapitated the last courier,

and took the route for himself.

And the Federation
has not intervened?

Where are you from?

Here we go.

- You have to go now... out the back.
- What?

But we've not held up our end
of the deal... your dilithium.

It won't matter
if we're all dead.

Please go!

You must be our friends

from the USS Discovery.

Hello, Kal.

How's the family?

There was no trace
of your vessel




( =  || []).({});

in our databases.

We are an older model.

Aren't we all?

They've been in contact
with other Federation ships...

who know where they are.

They've been adrift
for a long time.

Kal?

This is more
than I've heard you speak

since I've known you.

Our visitors must be having a...

garrulous effect.

It must have been
very disorienting for you.

Being adrift.

I'm good.

Good. We did,

however, register
a freaky signature

right before you got here.

High-energy gamma rays

and gravitational waves.

Do you know how those show up?

Why those show up?

I bet you do.

You look so smart.

Say it.

Our mission is not
of your concern.

Okay.

Get 'em a drink.

Put it in a flask.

We can drink as we walk.

- Where are you taking them?
- Really, Kal,

now you need
to shut the hell up.

They're taking me to their ship.

Uh... no.

It wasn't a question,
it was a statement.

There's no implied choice.

What is that you're hiding
behind your back, sweetheart?

Huh.

So if they crashed
and they needed you

to repair their communications,

well, that means that they
couldn't repair it themselves.

This is an easy fix

with up-to-date tech.

But you don't have
up-to-date anything.

High-energy gamma

and gravitational waves.

You're time travelers.

I'm sure they really appreciate
that repair job,

Kal.

I gave him no choice.

If you take issue with that,
you may take issue with me.

I'll take issue with him.

No.

Or you won't live long enough
to watch her die.

Give me those bags.

I want to see
what they brought with them.

Scan the perimeter, make
sure they were stupid enough

to come here on their own.

Aya, contact
the Tellarite Exchange.

I think we're gonna do better
breaking these down for parts.

Vintage tricorder,

communicator.

I'm gonna get these
to the Orions myself.

Zareh?

I am willing
to discuss an exchange.

Those items for the release
of Os'Ir and Tilly.

Uh, we will get further
using the common tongue.

Any captain with
some miles on him...

Even a V'Draysh captain...

Would know Pidgin.

Are you new?

I should offer
my congratulations.

The thing is...

you got no authority here.

Whereas the Burn
was the best thing

that ever happened to me.

Any success you achieve here
will be short-lived,

because we will not permit
your tyranny to stand.

But here it is, standing.

And you...

and what's left of your ship

aren't enough to do
anything, really.

We're all adrift together.

All that matters now

is dilithium.

Make it through the night,
you'll understand that.

So... shall we?

I have made my position clear.

I will not take you to our ship.

Principles, I get it.

If dilithium is your priority,

you and I will discuss
a reasonable trade here.

Then we will go back to the ship
to retrieve the dilithium.

Don't waste my time, or your 72

- crew members...
- 88.

Our wounded are still our crew.

...88 crew members on board
your ship will, you know...

regret it.

You're running out of time

to get the Discovery
off the ground.

The ice...

it's parasitic.

It'll crush the hull.

And eventually everyone inside.

- I'm at Junction XG11-Beta.
- What now?

Tube will curve in three meters.

Damaged relay is one meter
beyond that.

Commander?

Linus said Georgiou left
Deck Eight to help out here?

And you believe that?

Georgiou? Helping?

Seriously?

Damn it.

- 200 units.
- 100.

175.

150 units.

See, that wasn't so hard.

Now you.

I genuinely like you.

And I believe you'll come
back with my property.

So you're gonna go get me

that dilithium.

How about we wait here,

where it's cozy... but be quick,

Ensign.

Come nightfall,

the ice...

well, it does what parasites do.

It infests everything.

I've seen it get
down someone's throat.

But you look like you
can handle yourself.

Maybe you can outrun it.

Explosives help.

You forge yourself a path...

back to us once it's dark.

Okay, sweetheart?

Don't forget to disengage
the infuser matrix

when you get there.

Do I look like I was hatched
yesterday?

Do I look like a man who has
no idea what he's doing?

No, but you do look like a man
who is pain-free

and enjoys mixing metaphors.

Keep at it, Cranky Pants.

They said you might need
some help in here?

No. We're at the ne plus ultra

of personal satisfaction.

Say it just like that.

"Ne plus ultra."

You okay up there?

Stamets?

- Paul?
- Is he okay?

Get Culber in here.

We found her walking
the perimeter.

Did I interrupt
a critical moment of diplomacy?

A one-woman tactical response.

V'Draysh has officially reached
its nadir.

A fancy vocabulary
doesn't mean you're scary.

It means you have a thesaurus.

Shoot her.

No, shoot him.

He's gonna get you k*lled.

This is when you ask why.

Why?

Glad you asked.
You think you're the only ones

that saw a big ship fall
from the sky?

He knows your competitors

probably detected the ship, and
they're already on their way.

But he hasn't told you, you're
too weak to take them out,

and you don't have
the firepower.

- Enough.
- I'm gonna enjoy this new world.

If this idiot can run
a settlement,

then imagine what I can do
in my sleep.

You got a mouth.

But I got a g*n.

We're gonna make this go
real slow.

On my mark, get behind the bar.

She's intense.

Go!

What you call pain,

I call foreplay.

Georgiou,
you will not harm him further.

That is an order.

Killing him would be a service
to the galaxy.

Even you can't deny that.

This is not who we are.

It is who I am.

Guys.

Daylight's gone.

We are running out of time.

Reach out

your hand.

Jett, I told you

to come see me
if the pain got bad.

Ow.

Wasn't gonna leave him.

What are you doing, Paul?
You're in a Jefferies tube!

What the hell were you thinking?

Hey, genius,
he's stuck in a tube

in a ship in a vice, and he's
bleeding all over the place.

Argue about this later.

Listen, Paul,

everything is gonna be
all right.

We're gonna focus on one moment
at a time, okay, and...

- we're gonna do all of this slowly and carefully.
- Mm-hmm.

Because I need you out of there
alive, so I can k*ll you.

Stamets,

- I know you love the sound of my voice...
- You realize

- this is my nightmare.
- I live to serve.

Use your multi-tool
to open that compartment.

Take hold of the infuser matrix

and remove it.

Easy breathing, okay?

Try to slow it all down
if you can.

Pull out the damaged

anodyne circuit.

Replace it

with the new one.

Now replace

the infuser matrix.

I think I...

Did I do it?

Yes, you did.

Hugh... thanks.

Jett...

thanks for nothing.

Back at you, bobcat.

Bobcat?

I don't know, I'm on drugs.

Commander Georgiou,
give me your weapon.

Move... out of my way.

This degree of violence

is completely
without justification.

If not for me,
you'd both be dead. And he'd

be taking our dilithium
as we speak.

Shoot them, or you'll
never get another delivery.

I'll take out the silos
that maintain your atmosphere.

Your kids will die gasping.

Gasping!

Sorry, sweetheart.

Give me your weapon now.

I like my weapon.

We defeated Control
and lost lives in the process.

That sacrifice was not
for this, Commander.

I am the acting captain
of the vessel

that brought you here.
Stand down!

Kal always believed that you
were out there somewhere...

and that we were part of
the Federation no matter what.

I get now why he
never stopped talking about you.

I am truly sorry

we could not save him.

We will send
more than enough dilithium

for you to reach
the Exchange Kal mentioned

and repair
your mining equipment.

And we will leave you
his vessel.

But it is not our place
to decide his fate.

It is yours.

We have done enough damage here,

and we humbly apologize.

You're free to go.

I won't last the night.

You were willing to send her
out there.

Can I give him your pack?

And if I see you reaching
for it...

...I'll shoot you in the back.

Aah!

And if you manage to live

and decide you're feeling
punitive about this settlement,

I'll come back
and rip your throat out.

We'd better get you back
to your ship.

Personal transporter.

Welcome to the future.

Commander, internal comms
are back up and running.

We are good to go.

All crew,
this is Commander Saru.

Stations, please.

- Tactical is still off-line.
- Our sensors at 73%.

External comms
still reinitializing.

Three minutes until ready.

Shields back
in three minutes as well.

Other operational systems
on line,

none at full functionality
just yet,

but we'll be all right.

Lieutenant Detmer?

Lieutenant Detmer,
status report.

Impulse engines and maneuvering
thrusters are ready, sir,

- but... we've never...
- I am well aware that starships

were not designed for liftoff
in this fashion, but...

we have no choice.

Full power, please.

Aye, sir.

Full power to thrusters.

Hold us steady, Lieutenant.

Divert all auxiliary power
to main thrusters.

Diverting power now, sir.

Our sensors are showing
hull strain on the lower decks.

System temperatures
are exceeding nominal levels,

- Commander.
- Commander, something is coming toward us.

Something big.

Enemy vessel right on top of us.

It seems like Zareh's more
powerful friends have found us.

Red alert. Shields up.

I need 18 more seconds.

Lieutenant Detmer,
get us out of here.

I'm trying, sir.

Lieutenant, where are we
with those shields?

Tractor beam. They've
grabbed ahold of our ship.

The comms are back on line,
Commander.

- A-And we're being hailed.
Shields are also back on line.

Weapons armed

and ready.

What do you want us to do?

Open a channel, Mr. Bryce.
We will face

whatever or...

whomever has come for us...

together.

Channel open.

On viewscreen, please.

- Oh, my God.
- She made it.

Saru.

Michael?

Yeah.

It's me.

I found you.

I've been looking for so long.

You... you're...

You look...

Saru...

I landed here a year ago.

I've been waiting

for all of you...

all this time.
