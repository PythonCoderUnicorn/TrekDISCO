Previously
on Star Trek: Discovery...

Commander, I can't get contro!

All decks prepare for impact!

Lieutenant, get to sickbay.

Neurological tests are clear,

no concussion...
You're good to go.

What?

I said you're good to go.

We made it through.

It was a pretty rough landing.

It's good to have you alive.

I'm experiencing
some discomfort.

Yeah, you were impaled
by a seven-inch shard

and put in a coma.

Michael?

Saru, I landed here a year ago.

Nobody knows if The Burn
was an accident

or a natural disaster,
but I did find part of

a transmission from an obsolete
Starfleet channel.

This is Admiral Senna Tal.

I will wait for any
who would join us on Earth.

The Federation lives on.

Is he at Starfleet headquarters?

We will find Admiral Tal.

Senna Tal, the Starfleet officer
you've been looking for?

I know him.

Young Adira has been
joined with a Trill

- symbiont.
- Trill?

A sentient life-form.

Once they join with a host,

that host has the ability

to access the memories
of all former hosts.

Including Admiral Tal's.

It seems Adira has difficulty

accessing those memories.

She may carry knowledge
of what remains of Starfleet.

Medical officer's log,
supplemental.

Our trip to Earth
was eye-opening.

A reality check,
such as reality is.

It's starting to hit everyone

just how little
we have to hold on to.

The personal moments
we use to define ourselves,

birthdays,

anniversaries, graduations,

funerals,

we've jumped past all of them.

They feel lost.

Disconnected.

I tell them I've been alone,
I've been lost.

Both are survivable,

and surviving
can become living again.

You know, if you ever needed
to talk, I'm around.

I'm fine.

But first,
they have to accept help.

For a crew of overachievers,

that kind of vulnerability
can be hard to hold.

Five words keep everyone going:

"When we find the Federation."

It's become a mantra
for the crew.

In some cases, it seems to help.

All right.

In others...

...not so much.

Adira, who joined us from
Earth, may be able to guide s

to Federation headquarters one
she regains her own memoris

and those of her symbiont's
former host, Senna Tal.

This mission could be a gift,

a reminder that we are
and always will be connected

to something greater
than ourselves: the Federation.

Scan complete.

Well, the good news is,
she's perfectly healthy,

as is the symbiont.

Uh, should we be concerned
it is wrapped around her heart?

No, it's protecting me.

Every critical system in my body
is connected to Tal.

Wake up with a squid
in your abdominal cavity,

you'll do your homework, too.

So you still don't remember

how you got the symbiont?

What's the first thing
you do remember?

I woke up in an escape pod
a year ago

when that ship found me.

Before that, nothing.

Uh, Commander Stamets noted
that you demonstrated

a surprising understanding
of our ship's engineering grid,

a design about which
you should have no knowledge.

Well, I can also speak
seven languages

and cook
a mean Bajoran hasperat.

I mean, have I always
been a genius,

or do these skills belong
to my squid's previous hosts?

Well, if it is your sym...
Your squid...

Then we should be getting
the full picture.

So something is blocking
your memories.

Like what?

Oh, there's no way to know.

There's no precedent.

So, we have two choices:

I can start digging around
your hippocampus,

- hoping to find an answer...
- Bad.

Bad.

Or we take you to Trill.

If you and the captain agree.

Adira, we have to be clear.

No one's ever seen a human host.

There's no way of knowing if the
Trill will be able or willing

to assist you.

So I could go,
and it could be a bust,

and no one gets what they need.

I don't get my memories, you
don't get Senna Tal's message

and you never find
Federation headquarters.

Is there any way of knowing

if the Trill are as peaceful
as they were

a millennia ago?

No. That is also a risk.

I can't keep living like this.

Not knowing who I am.

Let's go to Trill.

Scans confirm
no weapon energy signatures.

Nothing to indicate
hostile intent.

Well, let us hope
that remains the case.

Keep us at yellow alert.

Lieutenant Bryce,
open a channel, please.

Yes, sir.

Ring any bells?

Does that planet look familiar?

Wish I could say yes.

All right, Captain,
Trill Commissioner Vos

is responding to our hail.

Put him through, Lieutenant.

Welcome, Commissioner Vos.

I am Captain Saru
of the USS Discovery.

Greetings, Captain Saru.

It's been many years since we've
seen a Federation starship.

I trust our arrival is welcome?

Most certainly.

We have a host and symbiont

on board, uh,
in need of medical attention.

We were hoping
for your assistance.

Our symbionts carry our history.

And t-then the... The Burn.

The population was decimated.

To have a symbiont return home
is a blessing.

Uh, we will send them down
immediately

accompanied by our ship's
medical officer.

We'll make preparations.

Thank you, Discovery.

Cancel yellow alert,
maintain standard orbit.

Dr. Stamets.

I would like to talk to you
about your jumps.

Second jump with no problems.

Fully recovered. I'm fine.

You were impaled with a spike
and placed in a coma.

Yeah, but other than that,
he's fine.

I can jump anytime.

The scarcity of dilithium
has made the spore drive

immeasurably valuable.

We will need the ability
to operate it

without you, Commander.

I researched
the nonhuman interface

for nearly a decade before
we discovered the Tardigrade

on the Glenn.

Yes, and there has been
932 years

of technological advancement
since then.

We cannot risk
becoming as limited

as every other ship
in the galaxy

should you be once again
incapacitated.

Of course, Captain.

Now, you and Ensign Tilly

are two of the finest minds
on this ship.

I have every confidence
you will find a solution.

So, look, I-I know
now may not be the best time...

Um, what if we made
a new interface

using a dark matter system?

Dark matter is comprised
of subatomic particles

and the mycelial network
is a subspace domain.

The prefix "sub"
being the only morpheme

that even remotely connects
those two ideas.

Yeah.

I... Well, I've run
some preliminary calculations

using dark matter energy to-to
pierce the subspace domain,

but if... look... you're not ready
to talk about it, it's...

Look, this isn't about
"Isn't science cool?"

It's about the lives
of everything and everyone.

I know you're trying,

but please, don't waste my time.

Come.

Do you have a minute?

Please.

- You've been busy.
- Mm.

It's everything I've managed
to find on The Burn

in the last year.

So many missing pieces.

Oh, I just, I meant,
your space used to be so, uh...

Oh.

Empty?

Yeah.

Shouldn't you, uh,
be headed to the shuttle now?

Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

I think you should be the one
to take Adira to the surface.

Her memory loss
isn't a medical problem.

She needs somebody
to support her emotionally.

Why do you think that's me?

Well, Adira's had almost
everything she's depended on

stripped away.

I think you understand that.

I think you do, too.

Mm-hmm.

You know, there's a theory:
post-traumatic growth.

That, uh,
certain life events, um,

dying, time travel,

a year alone in a new future,

can inspire us to evolve,

to live our lives
in a different way.

You're still in the process
of all that,

but Adira's about to start.

I don't even know
how to navigate

being on this ship right now.

And the people
that I know and love,

I know what they want from me...

...but I can't even
give it to them.

You know what I love
about you most?

You're a responsibility hoarder.

Yeah.

I am working on it.

Your friends, your crew,

the future of every living thing
in the galaxy, literally.

Even when
you're struggling yourself.

I'm sorry, I just don't
get why you're going with me.

You know less about me than
I do, and that's saying a lot.

A year ago, you woke up
with no memories

and I woke up with no past,
and ten seconds

after I crash-landed
out of the wormhole, I puked.

Okay, that's not exactly
a confidence booster.

I bet.

Okay, um, look, maybe
I should just go by myself.

- If you're good.
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.

Okay.

Attention, all crew.

Rotation assignments have ben
posted and are...

Look, Dr. Culber's
a pretty smart guy.

I've trusted him with my life,
and I'd do it again.

And he thinks
I should escort you.

Well, I like him.

So... you can come.

But, um, two things.

Wait. So you're saying
you trust Dr. Culber

because you like him,
not because he's a doctor?

Okay, look, I have a squid,
and you threw up in a wormhole.

Things are pretty weird
out here,

but human connection is
at least one thing I understand.

Okay. Shoot.

Whatever happens out there,

I don't want to let anyone down.

You won't.

What's the second thing?

Oh, uh, don't say anything
annoyingly inspirational.

That makes me nuts.

Deal.

Shuttlecraft Three, you are
cleared for safety check.

As requested,
I've completed my analysis,

and all crew members
are physically sound.

Y-You did not say "healthy."

Correct.

Well, but?

Stress hormone levels
are off the charts.

If they were mice in a cage,

they'd be gnawing
at their own tails.

So would you, by the way.

My tail and I appreciate
your concern, Doctor.

However, I need to know
how I can help this crew.

Perhaps a-a focus
on duties or routine?

Under any other circumstances,
those things might be helpful,

but...
we're in uncharted territory,

and they know it.

Discovery could disappear
tomorrow,

and it wouldn't make a ripple.

No one would miss us
or mourn us.

They need to feel connected.

Yes.

Welcome to Trill.

Uh, may I present Guardian Xi
of our spiritual community

and Leader Pav.

Thank you.

I'm Commander Michael Burnham,

and this is Adira.

Your captain said that you'd be
bringing a symbiont and host.

Yes.

She is...

...human?

Yeah.

Uh, she is.

Please...

speak your names.

Um...

Adira.

Continue?

That's it.
That's my name... Adira.

You recall no other names?

Well...

I-I... I know Senna Tal,
I guess.

She's unable to access
the memories of her symbiont.

That's why we've come.

In 2,000 years,
there hasn't been a single

recorded instance
of a successful

joining between a symbiont
and a non-Trill species.

It's a miracle
this symbiont is still alive.

Well, I wouldn't let it die.

Uh, it's a part of me.

It's a part of you?

She has no idea. None.

Why don't you give us an idea?

She's an abomination.

They must be separated
immediately.

We cannot. Forced separation
could k*ll the host.

Oh, no.

No one is forcing anything.

We are not Federation members.

You have no jurisdiction here.

Trill law takes precedence.

Adira's life takes precedence.

Our apologies.

Every Trill longs to be a host.

Few ever receive the honor.

The Burn decimated
our population,

particularly
those capable of joining.

We no longer have
enough viable hosts.

Adira could be our future.

If we could finally
look beyond the Trill...

- Absolutely not.
- Let us take Adira

to the Caves of Mak'ala,

where her symbiont might be able
to communicate.

She will contaminate
a sacred space!

- The symbiont is not hers.
- Enough.

We've never forced a separation.

We will not start now.

However,

I agree that the joining
is an aberration.

From what I'm hearing,
this joining is a miracle.

Maybe the symbiont
made the choice.

The memories that she's carrying

can help heal
the entire Federation.

And Senna Tal wanted us
to receive his message.

The longer she stays,
the greater the challenge

to the only thing
our species have left...

Our ideals.

My decision is final.

You will leave Trill
immediately.

So, that's it?

They're just kicking us off
their planet?

Don't say anything else.

This isn't the way
to our shuttlecraft.

The symbiont belongs with us.

It is a part of her.

It is not your choice.

I'm making it my choice.

Where are the caves?

Never.

Fine.

Um, that...

That wasn't Federation protocol.

No, it wasn't.

- They'll be fine.
- Michael?

Wait. Please.

Our society is on the brink
of collapse.

Helping you gives us
a fighting chance.

The caves are this way.

The crew would benefit

from exercise, medication,
limited dairy.

Oh, uh,
beyond the standard parameters.

Yoga, hyperbaric chamber,

therapeutic coloring books,
interstellar shopping.

Uh, I do not need
an endless list of activities.

I-I... I need something
meaningful to heal my crew.

Computer?

Hello.

Hello.

Among many sentient beings,

laughter is both healing
and meaningful.

Twentieth-century Earth
comedians such as Buster Keatn

or Charlie Chaplin
are communal unifiers

without the burden of language.

Buster Keaton?

Also known as
"The Great Stone Face."

Computer...

run a level ten diagnostic.

I'm fully operational,
thank you.

These connections are beyond
the algorithm I presumed...

Your crew requires
what they used to call

R and R, Captain.

May I suggest switching
the ship to auto-navigation

and giving them the night off?

The night off?

May I also suggest
simple gratitude?

A private meal, perhaps,
with your bridge crew,

to demonstrate
your appreciation.

Your choice, Captain.

The Sacred Caves of Mak'ala.

This is incredible.

And you believe that Adira's
symbiont would be able

to communicate with her here?

It's their ancestral home.

If not here, then where?

It feels...

safe.

We don't have much time.
Vos will awaken,

and the commission will see
that your ship is still here.

Okay, are you ready?

Say something inspirational.

Just don't make it annoying.

Uh, get in there
before someone shoots us?

Okay.

Friends, please, come in.
Come in.

Uh, sit, please.

I gave the rest of the crew
the evening off to recuperate.

But I asked all of you here

because we work most closely

and have not had a moment.

In fact,
we have lost quite a few.

Almost every culture
has a ritual

that gathers its moments
when it can,

holds them dear.

A time to take the measure
of loved ones

and what we have all
accomplished together.

Ah.

Hmm.

We made a choice

a millennium ago

to follow Commander Burnham.

I will never forget what I heard

as I stood before each of you
as you cast your vote.

It was not unlike...

a small prayer.

I ask that we repeat that now.

- Must we really?
- Yes, we must.

Lieutenant Detmer,

do you remember what you said?

I said "Aye."

I said, "Aye."

- Aye.
- Aye.

-Aye. -Aye.

-Aye, sir. -Aye. -Aye.

- Aye.
- I never said "Aye."

But... I'm here.

Aye.

Aye.

Is there any way the symbiont
was joined with Adira

against her will?

A symbiont can't thrive
in an unwilling host.

So the issue might be
with Adira herself.

A repressed memory
related to the joining, perhaps.

Whatever it is,
she will need to face it.

It's not exactly my style.

Please... enter.

This is as new to us
as it is to you.

We cannot know how your brain
will process what you see.

The Mynh'ta Orb
will allow us to track

her isoboromine levels.

As long as they are steady,
she is safe.

If you find Senna Tal
down there...

...his message is pretty vital.

I know.

Good luck, Adira.

She is now in communion.

Is that droog-beetle pie?

Mmm.

What is going on
between you two?

I don't know.

Nothing.

This reminds me of harvest
on Kaminar.

Siranna and I would work
from sunup

until after sunfall, gathering

and drying
our seasonal kelp crops.

Our family would then

dine together
under the full moon.

Kelp dries in the sun.

An existential crisis.

Is there some dessert?

Is that a haiku?

Yes.

Emperor Georgiou.

Feasting on the finest cuts.

Snarfs cookies on the down-low.

I screwed up the last line.

No matter. Hear! Hear!

- Haiku?
- Oh.

- I puked upon...
- No. No.

...the Tellarite ambassador

once at Thanksgiving.

Yeah.

It was
an actual diplomatic crisis.

Okay, this is not what I want
to hear at dinner. I mean,

- who raised you people?
- Get Detmer to do one.

- No. No, I don't want to...
- Come on.

- Try. Try.
- No.

Okay.

The drones
can't get Stamets' blood

off the medbay floor...

No. Wait.

No one can clean
Stamets' blood...

Okay, I've got it. I've got it.

No one can get Stamets' blood...

Oh, shoot. No, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

Stamets' blood

is so red.

-Lieutenant.
-No, I've got it now.
I've got it.

- It's five, seven, five, right?
- I don't think this is...

- It's a poem.
- It's uncalled for.

- Officers.
- My life is not a joke
for the dinner table.

I wasn't trying to make a joke.

I was back at work

within a few hours
of being injured.

We wouldn't have gotten anywhere
near Earth if it weren't for me.

You're not the only one
to move this ship.

I'm the pilot.

We move it.

- I never said it was just me.
- You think

you're the only essential
personnel on this vessel.

Look at you.
It's written all over you.

- Lieutenant.
You want to fly
this monster?

Actually be responsible
for every single person

every single day,
or do you just want to be

the when-he-feels-like-it
superhero

and have everybody
kiss your ass?

The reality is I'm the only one
who can make the jumps.

I flew us into the future.

I landed this ship.




( =  || []).({});

- I landed Discovery.
- Yes,

- and we barely survived.
- Oh, my God.

Stop it! You guys are both
acting like complete assholes.

- Ensign Tilly.
- Why don't we all
just take a breath?

You guys think you have
the market cornered on pain?

All of our sacrifices,

all of our experiences

and our work, it matters.

The only way we're gonna

get through this is as a crew.

I have work to do.

You did land this monster.

He should be thanking you.

Keyla. Keyla?

Uh...

Well, at least
the wine was good.

Her levels are dropping.

I need to get her out.

Stop!

Guardian Xi.

You have betrayed your oath.

He's trying to save your lives.

- What's happening?
- I don't know.

I've never seen anything
like this.

- I-I have to help her!
- You cannot enter.

This girl is all we have!

Please, we can't
let her die in there.

Let her in.

She's gone. Where is she?

Help me
with the neural stabilizers.

These will help you
commune with her...

but only for a short time.

You have to go and find her
and guide her out.

Hurry, please.

Now.

Adira?

Adira, can you hear me?

Adira?

Adira?

Michael?

- Ah!
- Michael!

Did he tell you how
to get out of here?

Because there's no way out,
and I don't know

what I'm supposed to do.

Okay, what have you seen so far?

Watch it!

- What are those?
- I don't know. They do that

if I stay in one place
for too long.

Okay.

- It's happening.
- Have they done that before?

Yeah, the threads are
everywhere.

They keep coming after me.

- Let me try something.
- Ow! What the hell?!

This place is responding to you.

You're here to connect
with the symbiont.

And these threads...

they're trying to connect
with you.

I don't understand. I...

It's the symbiont.

It-it wants you to remember.
And these threads,

they-they must be connected
to your memories.

I know you're afraid,
but you have to let them

connect with you.

Okay.

Surgery bay 12,
prepping symbiont transfer

to Trill host.

Hold my hand.

When this is all over,

after you and the symbiont
have joined,

will you still be you?

Of course I'll still be me.

I will always be the Gray
you know and love.

I love you, Gray.

Gray.

That-That's his name.

He was my boyfriend.

Uh, we were together
on a, uh, a ship.

Um...

A generation ship.

It was trying to find
Federation headquarters.

Gray. We-we both...

We were both orphans.

But we had each other.

I really loved him.

Good. What else do you remember?

He was... He was Trill.

Um...

H-He was, uh, a host,

and I think
he was about to receive

his symbiont.

He looked so happy.

Okay, why aren't you?

I don't know, I don't, um...

I'm sorry, I... I just...

I-I need...
I need to get out of here.

You can't.

Not until
you finish remembering.

So, how long were you together?
You and Gray?

Try...

Try to see his face.

You don't like my playing?

No, I... do.

You said you'd be the same
after you became a host,

and all these things
you can do now,

it's kind of like
you're perfect.

Well, I already was
perfect. That's why you love me.

Okay.

I told you.

I'm still me.

I'm just... more me.

Which parts?

Like, what's you and what's...
all the other hosts?

There aren't any fences.

I'm many, and I'm one.

Like everyone.

I feel like I need to keep up.

You're being a crazy person.
It's-it's not a race.

I don't think I could ever do
what you did.

Bullshit.
The joining's based on trust.

I didn't just have to accept
Tal, Tal had to accept me.

The former hosts
had to accept me, too.

Like us.

I'd trust you with my life.

Me, too.

Gonna show me what's in that box
on your lap?

- Or keep sulking?
- Um...

This is, uh, a thing

that I made... for you.

You made it?
It's not replicated?

"Oh, I'm Adira, and I struggle

"with my own inadequacies
while I'm making amazing

art things that no one
in the galaxy can make."

How do you know
it's an art thing?

Because we have
a love thing, idiot.

And I know you.

No, I-I need to get out of here.

- Adira...
- Don't touch me.

Okay, the only reason

you're here is to get
that message from Senna Tal.

So do not pretend like
you are doing this for me.

- This is for you.
- It's for all of us.

We all want a future
that's real.

That matters.

If you don't face what this is,

no matter how painful,

you'll never move forward.

Adira!

Adira?

Adira. Open the box now!

Open the box!

I read that in a lot of
cultures on a lot of worlds,

stories are woven into
tapestries and quilts.

A piece might be a reminder

of someplace special or a moment

or a person they really loved.

See, um, this is the time
we broke the replicator

and it wouldn't stop
making apples.

Oh, this is from the time
that we played imaginary chess.

Mm-hmm.

This is our story?

Yeah.

It's a special time for you,
and it should be marked.

I wanted you to have something.

I love it.

And you're an art genius.

- No.
- Say it.

Okay, I'm an art genius.

Structural breach
force fields engaged.

All personnel to the evacuation
shuttle immediately.

- Emergency drones dispatched.
- Oh! Oh.

H-Help!

Medical!

Somebody help, please!

Medical, now!

Shh.

Life signs failing.

No, you have to help him.

Subject will not survive
treatment protocols.

Their lives.

All their memories will be lost.

Symbiont is stable and will
survive immediate transplant

to suitable host.

I'll-I'll take them.

What?

Just-just let me take them.

Okay? The memories,
the symbiont.

I-I know I'm not Trill,
but I'll keep them safe.

You would do that?

You have to ask?

Prepare for transfer.

Just hold my hand, okay?
Hold my hand.

You did it.

It's okay.

I missed you.

I missed you so much.

Tal accepted

each of us.

Joining made us more
than we could ever be alone.

And while a human joining
is unusual,

Tal accepts you, as well.

You're...

You're Senna Tal.

Welcome to the circle.

Thank you, sir.

Your message gave me hope.

It's time for us to go.

Please,

speak your names.

I am Kasha Tal.

Jovar Tal.

Madela Tal.

Cara Tal.

Senna Tal.

Gray Tal.

And I am Adira Tal.

Our deepest apologies,
Adira Tal.

We were wrong.

Guardian Xi,
what you have done here

will impact generations
of Trill to come.

Adira Tal,

it would be my honor

to guide and mentor you
on your new path.

Thank you.

But I believe I'm supposed
to stay with Discovery.

The symbionts are a gift for
everyone, not just the Trill.

And I think I'm supposed
to be that messenger.

You will keep us apprised
of your well-being?

Of course.

And perhaps someday,
when the Federation returns,

we will discuss
a different joining.

It would be our honor.

Thank you for doing this, sir.

I know it didn't go
the way that you hoped.

Captain Pike made
connecting with the crew

seem so... effortless.

For what it's worth, uh,
this was, like, a Tuesday

at my house growing up, so...

Sir...

...we made a decision together,

and we are living with it
together.

The fact that
you reminded us of that

and reminded us who we are
to each other, that...

Maybe this isn't my place
to say, but...

I think that's leadership.

Thank you, Ensign.

Captain.

Tilly, um...

Everything that I've done
since I've been on this ship

would have been impossible
without you.

I've failed
to let you know that.

I always knew it.

I failed to tell you.

I apologize.

Thank you. Thank you.

Uh, I've been wondering,

what did you learn
in your spore drive research?

Oh, nothing. I was...

looking at dark matter
and energy coefficients,

but the math didn't work, so...

A new interface using dark
matter would be revolutionary.

We should keep talking about it.

Okay.

Hey.

Are you okay?

No. Obviously.

That was hard for me to admit.

For anyone.

And you're a pilot.

Pilots are, um...

- Macho.
- Hmm.

I know.

Hmm.

That talk that you suggested,

maybe I could take you up on it?

Anytime.

All available crew,

please report
to shuttle bay for a surpris.

Hmm.

Yeah, okay.

It fills the room.

Joy?

Yeah.

We all had to stop pretending
we were fine first.

We are not, are we?

How could we be?

But we'll get there.

And you ed us closer.

Yeah. It was not pretty.

- It never is.
- Hmm.

Good choice, Captain.

No. I wish I could
take credit, Doctor.

This wasn't you?

Mm-mm.

I have a theory.

The sphere data was transmitted
here for us to protect it.

It lives on within Discovery.

As we are now
inextricably connected,

perhaps now it desires
to protect us.

Senna knew the algorithm we need
to find Federation headquarters.

I already did the math.

These coordinates...

They'll take you
where you need to go.

Thank you.

That's beautiful.

What is it?

It's, um, a lullaby.

I think Senna Tal's parents

used to sing it to him
when he was a kid.

All the hosts, their memories
are still coming to me.

I expect it'll take a while.

Your bowing could use some work.

If you're gonna insult
my musical ability

for the rest of my life...

You didn't tell her about me.

I'm not sure she'll believe me.

Pretty sure she will.

How are you here?

I-I don't know.

How is this supposed to work?

I don't know.

But like I said,

our bowing,
we can do better than that.

Well, we'll keep practicing.
