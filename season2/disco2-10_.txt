"Previously on"
"Star Trek: Discovery..."
"You are the only one who has"
"had contact with the Red Angel."
"You said you don’t understand"
"why it chose you."
"It guided me to a remote planet"
"and showed me..."
"the end."
"My perception of reality"
"was challenged"
"by visions from"
"a time-traveling entity."
"Who should help me"
"but you, of course?"
"After all, the entire"
"Klingon war was your doing."
"That version of me"
"that called your quarters home,"
"that version of me is dead."
"And I’m not going back."
"Would you please"
"just move forward"
"and let me do the same?"
"Whether I can issue orders"
"or not,"
"we have to get a team onto"
"that station and reset control."
"Michael, you have to open"
"the airlock."
"No. I’m not gonna eject you"
"into space."
"I will unlock this door."
"I will k*ll you."
"Everything is because of you."
"Because of me?"
"You have to find"
"Project Daedalus."
"Where is Project Daedalus?"
"Commander Airiam reminds us"
"that resilience"
"is an unshakable virtue."
"She was fiercely loyal..."
"to her crew..."
"to Starfleet."
"And, in her final moments,"
"she sacrificed herself"
"for that loyalty."
"That is how she’ll be"
remembered.
"Some people choose"
"to live their lives"
"as if nothing is a miracle,"
"but Airiam fought for her life,"
"and so everything was."
"Everything that she saw,"
"everything that she felt,"
"all of her memories,"
"they made a kind of..."
"constellation for her."
"I’m... I'm grateful to her"
"for that lesson."
"She was my friend."
"She said once,"
"without a hint of self-pity,"
"that the paths of trillions"
"of particles"
"had been forever changed,"
"simply because"
"she and her husband smiled"
"at each other."
"She was happy that together"
"they made the universe"
"a little less orderly."
"I just felt the weight"
"of what I had lost..."
"but she showed me that"
"my augmentation didn’t make me"
"an imitation of myself."
"It made both of us new."
"And that there could be"
"a future."
"She was right."
"There are so many reasons"
"to join Starfleet."
"We get to reach for the stars."
"We get to reach"
"for the best in ourselves."
"But, most important,"
"we get to reach for each other."
"We get to do what we love"
"alongside colleagues"
"who become friends..."
"who become family."
"And who better to stand with,"
"shoulder to shoulder,"
"facing those pivotal moments?"
"Who more painful to let go?"
"I am so sorry, Airiam."
"On Kaminar,"
"we sing songs of remembrance"
"for those who have been taken"
"from us too soon."
"This is a song of remembrance"
"for Airiam."
"You spoke beautifully."
"Thank you."
"I’m so sorry."
"I’m sorry you were confined"
"to quarters for so long."
"I told Captain Pike"
"you weren’t responsible."
"It’s okay."
"If I were in his shoes,"
"I’d have done the same."
"I just wish it had"
"played out differently."
Yeah.
Michael.
"I can feel what you’re trying"
"to do, Ash."
"I can."
"But Section 31 created Control,"
"and some future version"
"of it came here."
"And now Airiam is gone."
"You don’t think I knew"
"what was happening, do you?"
"Of course not."
"But your duty is still to them."
So...
"Let’s start with"
"everything we know."
"The A.I. is from the future."
"It infected Airiam"
"and forced her"
"to copy some of the"
"Sphere data into Control"
"so Control could evolve."
"We stopped her before"
"that could happen."
"How did the Section 31 program"
"designed to eliminate threats"
"become the threat?"
"Time travel."
"The one variable we cannot"
"possibly predict is the future."
"And clearly,"
"that future A.I. is built"
"on advanced technology of which"
"we have no understanding."
"How do we stop it?"
"To the best of our knowledge,"
"the future A.I. only infected"
"Airiam and Control."
"Airiam’s neural system was"
"erased before her funeral."
"As for Control,"
"it was used only by Section 31."
"We destroyed the station"
"where Control was located,"
"and, per your"
"suggestion, Admiral,"
"we advised all Section 31 ships"
"to run diagnostic tests."
"All came out clean."
"Let’s not celebrate just yet."
"The A.I. that infected Control"
"could have sent itself"
off-station.
"We have to assume that it’s"
"lying dormant for now,"
"but it could reemerge"
"at any time."
"And when it does, we have to"
"be able to destroy it somehow."
"Hi. Oh, um... Sorry, uh,"
"Captain... Admiral. Everyone."
"I-I should have knocked."
"Although it-it is kind of"
"pointless, these doors"
"pretty much open right on"
"their own most of the time."
"Ensign, did you need something?"
"Uh, uh, well, actually,"
"I found... I have something."
"I mean, I found something."
Um...
"So I was, uh..."
"I was reviewing some scans"
"of Airiam’s system,"
"and I-I found this weird"
"code, and at first,"
"I figured, uh, it’s just"
"some junk from an old update,"
"but then I discovered"
"it’s actually a file"
"that was implanted there"
"by a digital parasite."
"The file is called"
"Project Daedalus."
"Those are the last words"
"Airiam said to me."
"The file also contains"
"a bio-neural signature"
"of the Red Angel."
"Michael, it’s you."
"While Dr. Culber hasn’t been"
"officially reinstated,"
"I’ve asked him"
"to oversee analysis"
"of the data Tilly uncovered."
"The results are conclusive?"
"Well, every test that I’ve run"
"on Commander Burnham"
"is a 100% match"
"to the bio-neural signature"
"found in Airiam’s Daedalus file."
"We have to consider the source."
"Airiam was compromised."
"The A.I. could have"
"had her plant information"
"to throw us off course."
"I see no logical"
"or strategic reason"
"for Airiam to have provided"
"a false positive."
"And even if she had, it would"
"have read too perfect."
"Humans have a few"
"neural wild cards"
"that anything artificially"
"generated couldn’t replicate."
"I would have caught it."
"We’re saying that Michael,"
"our-our Michael Burnham,"
"is going to wake up one day,"
"access time-travel technology"
"that doesn’t exist yet,"
"and take it upon herself"
"to save the galaxy."
"That supposition fits"
"her emotional profile"
"rather precisely,"
"particularly her drive"
"to take responsibility"
"for situations"
"often beyond her control."
"Thank you for sharing that"
"with the group, Spock."
"We must also assume"
"the cataclysmic events I foresaw"
"when the Angel appeared to me"
"are a result"
"of Control evolving,"
"achieving consciousness."
"Let’s assume for a moment"
"I am the Red Angel."
"If I knew about an apocalypse,"
"why wouldn’t I say so?"
"Perhaps you simply have"
"a penchant for the dramatic."
Okay.
"The suit was emitting"
"tetryonic radiation,"
"which would limit"
"traditional radio"
"and sensor communication."
"That would explain"
"my difficulties"
"in mind-melding with it."
"And why it put seven signals"
"in the sky."
"It was trying to get Starfleet’s"
"attention, maybe to warn us."
"But the first three signals"
"appeared on the asteroid,"
"Terralysium, and Kaminar,"
"with four left"
"to reveal themselves."
"If I’m guiding Starfleet"
"to these specific places"
"on some sort of path, why?"
"What do these locations"
"have in common?"
"- Admiral. Captain."
"- We’ve just received word"
"that a Section 31 vessel"
"is on its way."
"The Federation has cleared"
"Discovery, Lieutenant Spock"
"and Commander Burnham"
"of all charges."
"If you came all this way"
"to arrest somebody,"
"you wasted a trip."
"We’re aware, Admiral."
"Chris, I’m sorry"
"for the loss of"
"your crew member."
"We’re here to make sure"
"nothing else from the future"
"can attack the Federation."
"We’re already working"
"on a strategy."
"In other words,"
"you’re accumulating input,"
"which only invites debate."
"No debate, no innovation."
"I prefer a little"
"totalitarian efficiency,"
"but that’s me."
"Admiral, we have a solution."
"I’m cringing already."
"The Angel is the only one"
"with answers about the future,"
"the A.I."
"and perhaps how to stop it."
"And we can’t predict"
"when or how it will appear."
"Correct. So..."
"we set a trap, we capture it"
"and make it work for us."
"The Red Angel’s"
"bio-neural signature"
"was hidden inside Airiam’s data"
"in a file called"
"Project Daedalus."
"Are you absolutely certain"
"it was a match to Michael?"
"It’s me."
"As the Angel travels"
"through time,"
"she opens a micro-wormhole"
"along with the possibility that"
"a future A.I. will follow her."
"We can’t let that happen again."
"Agreed. Which is why"
"we have to stop her"
"from traveling back and forth."
"We have to capture her."
Me.
"So, how do you propose"
"we trap her?"
"20 years ago,"
"we discovered the Klingons"
"were researching time travel."
"Obviously a critical"
"threat... a warrior race"
"with the ability to rewrite"
"the past and shape the future?"
"They’d have wiped us out"
"before we could even walk"
"out of the primordial soup."
"No offense."
"None taken."
"They would’ve."
"We found ourselves"
"in a temporal arms race, so"
"to gain a strategic advantage,"
"we developed"
"The Daedalus Project."
"It’s ours."
"Section 31’s grand"
"design for time travel."
"You created the Red Angel?"
"The suit was on the"
"verge of being tested"
"when it was destroyed"
"by Klingon spies."
"We thought they had abandoned"
"the project permanently."
"Until the signals began."
"Once the suit appeared"
"alongside the signals,"
"we started working"
"on a way to capture it."
"A mousetrap, if you will,"
"to get our technology back."
"And the individual"
"using that technology?"
"She will not be harmed."
"There are gaps in your story"
"that I find disconcerting."
"I’ve told you everything"
"you need to know."
"Not if I’m the mission, sir.Burnham."
"I have the technical"
specifications
"and a list"
"of, uh, equipment required."
"Provided I may borrow some of"
"your top minds to build it."
"You can work with Commander"
"Stamets. He’s one of our best."
"Even if they succeed,"
"there is still the matter"
"of predicting"
"the Angel’s next appearance."
"She has not"
"consistently accompanied"
"the arrival of the signals."
"Signal or no signal,"
"there has to be a pattern"
"to my jumps."
"And once we find it,"
"we’ll find me."
"I’ll figure out a way to close"
"the wormhole once she gets here."
"The graviton beams on our ship"
"should be powerful enough."
"I would be happy to assist you"
"with the calculations,"
"Captain Leland."
Admiral?
"Let’s go build a mousetrap."
"Georgiou, wait."
"What aren’t you telling me?"
"How many times"
"have you asked me that?"
"Aren’t you getting bored?"
"I’ll stop asking when it"
"stops being a question."
"I know there’s more to"
"that Daedalus story."
"We shared"
"what we needed to share."
"At least, I have.Philippa."
"I’m putting my life"
"in your hands."
"You asked for my trust."
"I’m giving you a way to earn it."
"I’m not the one"
"with the information"
"you need to hear, Michael."
Leland?
"It’s my experience"
"it’s often our best intentions"
"that cause us"
"to do the most harm,"
"especially to those we care for."
"This is the Red Angel."
"A suit that lets someone travel"
"through time"
"via micro-wormholes."
"But wormholes"
"are inherently unstable,"
"so the Angel"
"needs to hold them open"
"or she won’t be able"
"to get home again."
"And as I understand it,"
"to keep the wormhole open,"
"the suit generates"
"a membrane, a protective"
"layer that travels with her,"
"and one end stays attached"
"to her starting"
"point in the future."
"An anchor."
"When she wants to go home,"
"it snaps her back"
"like a rubber band."
"Our phase discriminators"
"will hold the Angel"
"in stasis beams"
"so the membrane"
"can’t snap her back."
"And then we’ll lower"
"her to a platform,"
"where an electromagnetic pulse"
"will shut down the time crystal"
"that powers her suit."
"And, uh, then we"
"raise the containment field,"
"and that will hold her here"
"for as long as we want."
"And then, uh,"
"we can question her,"
"and nothing from the future"
"will be able to reach us. Right?"
"What’s that look on your face?"
"I was thinking you may be"
"smarter than the Stamets I knew."
"You’re also much more neurotic."
"Have you considered medication?"
"Um, based on my calculations,"
"the phase discriminators"
"should function properly."
"The problem is..."
"Uh, hey, Tilly."
"Is, um, Admiral Cornwell here?"
"I thought she might be..."
"Yeah. What? No, she’s not."
"No, but it is... it’s great..."
"uh, so great that you’re here."
"Please, your wide-eyed attempt"
"to release"
"this fabulous male tension"
"is a buzzkill."
"You never learned to relish"
"a little discomfort, Red?"
"Who raised you?"
"My-my mom. My mom."
"But she wasn’t around a lot."
"Stop talking."
"You said"
"there was a problem, Paul?"
"Uh, yes, with the..."
"the phase discriminators."
"Uh, we’d need the equivalent"
"of 12 warp cores"
"to generate enough energy"
"to-to run them,"
"and if we can even locate"
"that much power, it will be"
"almost impossible to control."
"Not for you."
"In fact,"
"we don’t need warp cores."
"One of the Project"
"Daedalus testing sites"
"was on Essof Four."
"Y-Yes, I’ve read"
"about that place."
"So much deuterium."
"We can use it to create"
"a plasma reactor"
"to power up"
"our phase discriminators."
"And then, snap,"
"we have our mouse."
"You are savvier than he was."
Um...
"you-you do know that"
"he’s gay, right?"
"Don’t be so binary."
"In my universe,"
"he was pansexual,"
"and we had DEFCON-level"
"fun together."
"And you, too, Papi."
"Did you just call me Papi?"
"Uh, well, in my universe"
"and pretty much any universe"
"I can possibly imagine,"
"I’m gay."
"And so is he. Of course you are."
"I’m glad we all see"
"what’s right in front of us."
"And now, if you’ll excuse me,"
"I need to talk to Captain Pike"
"about setting a course"
"for Essof Four."
"What just happened?"
Commander.
Hey.
"I just..."
"Look, my job is to preserve as"
"many lives as possible at any cost."
"But what you said"
"at the service..."
"It is hard to let go."
"You did the right thing."
"I’m grateful you were there."
"Strange way to get"
"to know someone, but..."
"after seeing how hard"
"you fought for her,"
"the real her..."
"Let’s just say I'm grateful"
"you were there, too."
"The wormhole used"
"by the Red Angel would close"
"on its own eventually,"
"but we must find a way"
"to force it closed immediately"
"or risk"
"another A.I. infiltration."
Unfortunately,
"Discovery’s graviton beam"
"is not powerful enough to..."
"Which is why I said"
"I’d do it from my ship."
"I’ll have Specialist Tyler help."
"We’ll close it fast."
"Did Captain Pike decide"
"that I needed a monitor?"
"Is that why you’re here?"
"I chose to work with you"
"because I wanted"
"to assess you myself."
"Section 31 has engaged"
"in questionable practices"
"of late."
"Given that we will be"
"working together"
"and the lives of those"
"I care for may be in your hands,"
"I need to know"
"that you can be trusted."
"If you can tell the answer,"
"I’m not doing my job very well."
"Even without my ganglia,"
"I still have"
"strong instinctive reactions"
"to dangerous situations"
"and individuals."
And?
"I believe you will work"
"to protect your crew and ours"
"to the very best"
"of your ability."
"I also believe"
"there are many things"
"you are not saying."
"Excuse me."
"Mr. Saru."
"May I have a moment"
"with Captain Leland, please?"
"Certainly, Commander."
"Captain, we’re preparing"
"a strategy to capture me."
"I have a right"
"to know everything you do."
"As in everything you know."
"You are capable of some"
"intricate moral gymnastics."
"And that’s your job, right?"
"But I am giving you one chance"
"to explain everything"
"as you need to explain it."
"I knew your parents."
"They worked on Project"
"Daedalus for Section 31."
"I had them stationed"
"on Doctari Alpha."
No.
"We were stationed there"
"because my parents wanted"
"a change of scenery."
"And we only stayed"
"as long as we did"
"because I wanted to see"
"a star go supernova."
"You were there... because of me."
"Your parents..."
"Your parents"
"were k*lled there..."
"because of me."
"My parents... were scientists."
"My father was"
"a xenoanthropologist."
"My mother was an astrophysicist."
"They wouldn’t have been involved"
"in Section 31."
"She was also an engineer."
"A brilliant one."
"They were working on a theory"
"that sudden technological leaps"
"across certain cultures,"
"including those on Earth,"
"weren’t happenstance"
"but the result of time travel."
"No. They would have known"
"that certain leaps,"
including
"technological advancements,"
"can be explained."
"I wasn’t convinced, either."
"Until they built the suit."
No.
"No, they didn’t mention"
"anything like this to me."
"Because it was classified."
"And very dangerous."
"What did you have to do"
"with this?"
"The suit was missing a key"
"component: a time crystal,"
"the element that would enable"
"it to jump through time."
"We got Intel from an"
"operative on Qo’noS"
"that a time crystal had"
"hit the black market"
"near the Orion Outpost."
"I used my assets in"
"the sector to steal it."
"See, I thought"
"that we had made it untraceable."
"But the Klingons tracked it"
"to Doctari Alpha."
"Where a star"
"was about to go supernova,"
"releasing a massive amount"
"of energy."
"This whole time..."
"I thought..."
"We were there because of you?"
"For a time crystal?"
"And you let"
"the Klingons track it?"
"I was young,"
"I was ambitious, I..."
"I was careless."
"I should have done more"
"to protect your parents."
"I know how much this has"
"cost you, and I’m so sorry."
"I hope..."
"That’s for my mom."
"That’s for my dad."
"This isn’t over."
"I just uploaded all"
"the Section 31 signal data. Did you know?"
"( =  || []).({});"
"Know what? That Leland was responsible"
"for the death of my parents."
"You knew, didn’t you?"
"No.Don’t lie to me, Ash."
"Michael, I don’t know"
"what you’re talking about."
"Every moment"
"you work for Section 31,"
"you’re announcing who you are."
"You’re saying this is your"
"compass, this is your course."
"You can live with that?"
"Section 31 has"
"a specific mission."
"I don’t always agree"
"with their tactics,"
"but I do believe"
"in their mission."
"No matter who pays the price?"
"It’s not blackand-white."
"They-they also do a lot of good."
"I’ll take that as a yes."
Come.
"Admiral, uh,"
"they said you were here."
"Do you have a moment?"
"I do."
"You, uh, used to be a therapist."
"Yes, I’m aware."
"What’s on your mind, Doctor?"
Doctor.
"I can understand how that"
"might sound strange to you."
"I would assume"
everything
"is strange to you now."
"Your experience transcends"
"everything we know"
"about identity."
"I’ve never felt more alone"
"in my life."
"Even sitting here."
"Commander Stamets is the person"
"who knew you most profoundly."
"You used the past tense."
"Well, you are... new."
"I remember Paul."
"I remember loving him,"
"but if feels like a dream."
"It’s someone else's life."
"And I don’t know"
"what I feel about him now."
"Do you feel pressure"
"to feel something?"
"I can’t give him what he needs."
"And I don’t want to hurt him."
"All right. You know that."
"You know you don’t want"
"to hurt him. That’s not enough."
"Enough for what?"
"Enough for the man"
"I know loves me."
"And who I once loved."
"Love is a choice..."
"Hugh, and one doesn’t just"
"make that choice once."
"One makes it again and again."
"I’ll let you get back to it."
Doctor.
"The only way to make a new road"
"is to walk it."
"Thank you, Admiral."
"I’m sure Captain Leland"
"appreciates your choice"
"of high-density urethane foam"
"in lieu of his nasal cartilage."
"Spock, no offense,"
"but you’re the last person"
"I want to talk to right now."
"You are angry."
"An understandable reaction."
"You lost your friend."
"Knowing her death"
"was unavoidable"
"would not provide solace."
"You also learned"
"that you are the Red Angel,"
"which does not make"
"logical sense despite"
"its correlation"
"to your emotional profile."
Spock...
Finally,
"you discovered"
"your parents were k*lled"
"because of Captain Leland’s"
negligence,
"which does not make their loss"
"any more acceptable."
"I do wish I’d been there"
"when you struck him."
"I believe I would have"
"found the moment..."
satisfying.
"You have experienced"
"a series of events"
"in which both emotion"
"and logic have failed you."
"In my experience of this,"
"it is..."
uncomfortable.
Very.
"What you said about..."
"me always finding a"
"way to blame myself..."
"You are right."
"I brought my guilt"
"into your home."
"I’m sorry."
"You were a child..."
"with a child’s understanding"
"of an event"
"that even adults"
"would struggle to comprehend."
"However, if it will"
"ease your suffering,"
"I accept your apology."
"Thank you for coming"
"to talk to me."
"It was unexpected."
"And helpful."
"I had not anticipated"
"this conversation, either,"
"but I appreciate it, as well."
"So, why did you come"
"to see me, then?"
"In your absence,"
"I made a discovery."
"I now understand the variance"
"in the signal patterns..."
"What causes the Angel to appear"
"at certain times and not others."
And?
"The variance is you, Michael."
"We don’t have to wait."
"We can set the trap directly"
"on Essof Four."
"The plan was to power the"
"trap there and take it"
"wherever we find the Angel."
"What’s changed?"
"We’ve been trying to track her"
"by the signals,"
"asking when"
"she might appear somewhere."
"But what we should have been"
"asking is why."
"Why does she appear"
"where she does?"
"Each signal brought Discovery to"
"a location where"
"lives were saved."
"The Angel appeared at some of"
"those locations, but not all."
"Leaving no clear pattern"
"to suggest intent."
"However, there is a pattern"
"to her appearances"
"without any signal."
"As when Spock was a boy and it"
"warned him that I was in danger,"
"when it appeared to me on the"
"asteroid when I was injured,"
"seeing it gave me strength,"
"knowing that help was"
"on the way."
"You were saving your own life."
"The Grandfather Paradox."
"Future Burnham would not exist"
"if Present Burnham were"
"to perish."
"When Michael’s life"
"was in danger,"
"her guardian Red Angel"
intervenes.
"Which means"
"I have to be the bait."
"What does that mean exactly?"
"The place doesn’t have"
"a breathable atmosphere."
"We set a trap, I go down."
"You let me start to suffocate."
"Are you insane?"
"Absolutely not."
"The Angel will protect her,"
Captain,
"or her efforts to"
"communicate with us,"
"to save the galaxy,"
"would be for naught."
"And if anything were"
"to not go as planned,"
"Dr. Culber will be right there"
"to resuscitate me."
"But we do not believe he will"
"ultimately be necessary."
"I’m not looking forward to it,"
"Captain... far from it..."
"But we do not see any other way."
"What you are asking me to allow"
"is in direct opposition"
"to the oath I took"
"as a Starfleet captain."
"I understand,"
"but with all due respect,"
"between risking myself"
"and risking all sentient life,"
"there is no choice."
"Captain, if we’re going to capture"
"the Red Angel, you have to let me die."
"To call Essof Four inhospitable"
"would be a gross understatement."
"Temperatures fluctuate wildly."
"And its carbon monoxide"
atmosphere
"is laced with perchlorate dust"
"which will quickly prove lethal"
"to any oxygen-breathing"
life-form.
"But the facility itself"
"has oxygen, doesn’t it?"
"That is correct."
"So we’re going to the"
"Ninth Circle of Hell to capture"
"a Red Angel."
"I’d enjoy the irony of that"
"if this weren’t so dangerous."
"Commander Stamets,"
"your work must be precise."
"We have to succeed"
"on the first attempt."
"We won’t have"
"another opportunity."
"Once Commander Burnham is"
"strapped into that chair,"
"the roof will recede,"
"she’ll be exposed"
"to the toxic atmosphere,"
"and she will have exactly"
"two minutes to live."
"And she’ll suffocate..."
painfully.
"Dr. Culber, be prepared"
"to breach the target"
"area and resuscitate."
"I will. Don’t worry, sir."
"But you cannot"
"revive her too early,"
"or the Angel will not appear."
"And if she does not,"
"we will lose much more than"
"the life of Michael Burnham."
"All sentient life will be lost."
Hey.
"May I come in?"
Yeah.
"I’m glad you're here."
"You have to know,"
"what happened to your parents..."
"Please don’t apologize."
"What I said to you was not fair."
"I was angry,"
"and I didn’t know"
"where to put it."
"I think you put it where"
"you knew it would be okay."
"I don’t... I don't want that"
"to be our last conversation"
"if, um..."
"No, don’t even think that way."
"This will work."
"You have an entire crew"
"dedicated to saving your life."
"You have me."
"I’m scared."
"Me, too."
"Captain, the facility"
"is prepped and ready."
"The away team is on site."
"Welcome to the bridge,"
"Lieutenant Nilsson."
"Standing by, Captain."
"Bringing phase discriminators"
online.
"We didn’t get a chance to"
"talk at Airiam’s funeral."
"I just..."
"wanted to say I’m sorry."
"Thank you."
Paul...
"This isn’t the time."
"Might not ever be the time."
"Are you ready?"
"As I’ll ever be."
"Michael Burnham,"
"always willing"
"to sacrifice everything"
"for the good of others."
"We’ll monitor exposure time"
"from the moment"
"the roof retracts."
"Why didn’t you just tell me"
"about my parents?"
"It wasn’t my story to tell."
"But I could make certain"
"it was told."
"I got to go."
"Let us hope the Angel"
"lives up to her name."
"Captain Leland,"
"are you and Mr. Tyler ready"
"to go?"
"Standing by to close the"
"wormhole in the Angel’s wake."
"Make it fast."
"Trust me, the last thing I want"
"is another A.I."
"infecting our systems."
Michael...
"I know, Ash."
"What if it doesn’t work?"
"Were you to perish,"
"I would be charged with killing"
"a Starfleet officer."
Again.
"It would therefore be ideal"
"if you survived."
"Such a way with words, Spock."
"On your mark, Commander."
Ready.
"Shutting down life support."
"Starting timer now."
"Two minutes and counting."
"Oxygen saturation"
"level’s at 85%,"
"and falling fast."
"If it drops below 40,"
"she won’t make it."
"Ensign Tilly, tachyon update."
"Ensign, are you picking up any"
"spikes in the tachyon radiation?"
"Sorry, sir."
"Um, no change."
"What if she isn’t coming?"
"Oxygen saturation"
"is down to 62%."
"Heart rate spiking."
"She wants out."
"It’s over."
"We’re coming to get you,"
Michael.
"Wait. She’s saying something."
Var-Var...
Variance.
"She said variance."
"I don’t give a damn"
"what she said."
"Get the oxygen."
"Follow me."
"Michael means that"
"she is the variance."
"She is creating a"
"situation where"
"the Red Angel will have"
"no choice but to save her."
"That thing is not coming,"
"and Michael"
"is shaking her head no!"
"Because she does not"
"want interference."
"We must let it proceed."
"Oxygen is down to 42%."
"If I don’t get to her,"
"she’ll die."
"Yes, Doctor."
"That is the idea."
"Status reports."
"No change in tachyon levels."
"Sensors stable on my end, too."
"No sign of the Red Angel."
"Your call."
"- This operation is over."
"- Away team, get her out of there."
"We can’t, sir."
"Lieutenant Spock is"
"holding us hostage."
"Says we have to let her die."
"Damn it, Spock, stand down!"
"I’m sorry, Captain."
"I cannot."
"- Spock, stand down!"
"- That’s an order!"
"I am sorry, Captain. I cannot."
"Ops, beam Commander Burnham"
"directly to sickbay now."
"I can’t, Captain."
"There’s too much interference"
"to get a lock on her."
"Interference from what?"
"I’m detecting a massive surge"
"in tachyon radiation."
Captain!
"Get us over there! Now!"
"Shields up. Red alert."
"Get ready, Spock."
"It’s coming."
"I need eyes. Working on it."
"I’m having trouble stabilizing"
"the beam. I need more power!"
"Keep firing. I’ll override"
"the security buffers."
"Get that damn thing closed"
"as soon as you can!"
Now!
Authorizing
"security buffer override."
"System offline."
"Tyler, I need..."
"System online. Never mind."
Authorizing
"security buffer override."
Working.
"Let’s go. It is not that hard."
"Let’s go. Let's go."
"It is not that hard."
"Tyler, you should have"
"the power you need now."
"Wormhole’s closed!"
"Reengaging atmosphere."
"Systems back up."
"Can you get out there"
"to Burnham?"
"Not yet. It’s not safe."
"Firing EMP."
"We have the Red Angel."
"Raising containment field now."
Mom?
