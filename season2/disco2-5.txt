Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

Emperor.
- You have me confused with someone else.

Section 31.

Control values his skill set.

He's in.

I've been waiting for an update
on my officer, Spock.

Your guy is wanted for m*rder.

He k*lled three of his doctors,
then fled the starbase.

Whatever happened,
he needs a fair shake.

We need to find him
before they do.

I found Spock's shuttle.

Plot a course
and don't spare the horses.

After the dark matter hit
me, I started to see a ghost.

It's me. Silly Stilly.

You are hosting

a multidimensional
fungal parasite.

How do we get rid of it?
- This might hurt a bit.

I'm from a
species known as the JahSepp.

An alien intruder began
ravaging our ecosystem.

You let Tilly go.
- I have other plans for her.

Wrong.

No! No!

Tilly!

No!

Make way!

Words define who we are.

Officer.

Orphan.

Widower.

Shipmate.

But there is no word
for the unique agony

of uncertainty.

I do not yet know
the fate of my friend.

Stamets refuses to lose hope.

He believes Tilly survived

whatever the alien
we call "May" did to her.

I want to believe
that's possible, too.

I want to have faith.

But in its absence,

only duty remains.

Captain, I've picked up the
trail of Spock's shuttle.

Alter course to intercept.

Spock's shuttle is
25,000 kilometers and closing.

One life sign detected.

His shields are up and
his weapons are hot, sir.

What is Spock doing?

Why the aggressive stance?

Uh, Captain,
Spock departed Enterprise

before you assumed
command of Discovery.

Perhaps he is unaware
that he's among friends.

Open a channel.
- Aye, Captain.

Lieutenant Spock,
this is Captain Pike.

Shut down your engines,
lower your shields,

prepare for transport.
- He's increasing speed.

Altering course to
enter the nebula.

Spock, you have my word.

I'm here to listen.
I'm here to help.

Did we lose him?
- No, sir.

He ignited the nebula's hydrogen
to disrupt our sensors,

then came to a full stop.

We flew right past him.
- Detmer, come around.

Captain, if he enters
the nebula, we will lose him.

Target that shuttle
with a class-five torpedo.

Detonate it 100 meters
before impact. Understood?

Aye, Captain.
- Fire.

The shuttle's been
disabled, sir.

Owo, lock on a tractor beam
and bring him aboard.

Burnham, with me.

Transfer operational control

to security team alpha.

Set phasers to stun.
- Aye.

Nobody fires without my direct order.
- Aye, sir.

Captain Georgiou?

Captain Pike.

Michael.

Commander.

Quite the welcome, my dear.

We met at the Academy.

Been a couple thousand
light-years since then.

Indeed.

You were a force to
be reckoned with.

Sharpest tool in the shed.

And despite being able to drink
any of us under the table,

you had every regulation
down by week two.

You're tactfully asking

why I didn't identify myself
when you hailed.

Identification is

standard procedure,
and that's a non-answer.

You haven't
lost a step, Captain.

I appreciate the compliment.

Starfleet records show...
you're retired.

Do I look retired?

You know, I had
a cousin like you.

She only ever gave a
straight answer in church.

So the only other explanation is

you're on a classified mission.

Hmm.

You like being
back in the saddle?

It's an invigorating ride.

This may clear
things up, Captain.

Section 31?
Fancy.

Covert ops. Intelligence
gathering. Threat assessment.

Fun times.
- What do any of those things

have to do with you
being on Spock's shuttle?

I've been authorized
to hunt down a Starfleet officer

wanted for m*rder.

Excuse me,

multiple murders.

By the time I caught up
to his craft,

it was adrift, and he was gone.

Any idea where he might be?

If I hear anything, you'll
be the first to know.

Will I?

Commander Burnham
has a hard time

believing those charges;
so do I.

The innocent don't run.
- You ran from us.

Exactly.

Christopher.

Leland.

Is that gray hair I see?

Yeah, well,
it's one of the trade-offs

of having actual hair.

Last time I heard about you,

you were up to your ass

in alligators on Cestus Three.

Exactly why I transferred
to Starfleet Intelligence.

I'm heading up Section 31.

Well, you were always
more comfortable

in the gray areas, my friend.

Seems you've intercepted
one of my agents.

Yeah, we've been
getting caught up.

Well, I'd appreciate
if you'd return

Agent Georgiou to her shuttle.

Clock is ticking.

She's tracking
a suspected m*rder*r.

Mr. Spock
is one of mine.

I can't reconcile
the charges with the man.

I respect that.

But having his commanding
officer or his sister

interfere with our
efforts to recover him?

Makes me look like
I'm doing an old friend a favor.

Leland, um,

I think there may be
a connection

between Spock and the signals
that have been dragging us

halfway around the universe.

There are lives at stake.

There are always lives at stake.
That's what keeps us employed.

See, we do what we do

so you can do what you do.

If I didn't know you better,

that would sound like a threat.

You know me pretty well.

I'll send a liaison.

If you could walk him
through what you know,

I'd appreciate it.

Always happy to do a favor
for an old friend.

You're free to go, Captain.

Your captain doesn't know
where I'm really from.

I'm under direct
Starfleet orders.

Yeah, to tell the truth
when it's convenient?

I'm learning to really like
Starfleet and Section 31.

Do you think they'll
give you free reign, huh?

That place has eyes
on eyes on eyes.

Well, it's a good thing
I do some of my best work

in plain sight.

Does Leland have any idea
who you really are?

You mean the Terran Emperor,

Philippa Georgiou
Augustus laponius Centarius?

He doesn't call me

by my proper name,
but yes, he does.

Then I trust him
about as much as I trust you.

You're the one who brought me
to this insufferable place.

You don't get to be
surprised I'm here.

And when I find Spock, I'll be
sure to pass along your regards.

If you lay a hand
on my brother...

You'll what?

Ah.

Now here's a woman I recognize.

Shuttle bay's through there.

I'm sure you need to get back
to your... snake pit.

Tell me you have good news.

The universe never lets
anything go to waste,

or so said Lavoisier.

The law of conservation of mass.
- Yes.

In chemical reactions,

mass is neither created
nor destroyed.

Look. Look, look, look.

I'm scanning the cocoon
for human remains.

Mitochondrial DNA,
lipids, proteins.

If all of Tilly's atoms

were transported,

rather than decomposed,

then there shouldn't be any
trace of her organic matter.

Which would mean May took Tilly
into the network.

Which would mean

we could get her out.

How?

I think that this cocoon
is an organic transporter.

Just like ours,

it-it breaks down
matter in one place

and then reassembles it,
completely intact, in another.

The mycelial version
of a transporter pad.

Which could mean
that a second cocoon

just like this one
exists somewhere in the network.

But why take Tilly
in the first place?

May came here to deliver
a message to you.

May said she had
a special connection with Tilly.

She said she needed her.

Look.

No human material present.

Tilly's alive.
I know it.

But the network is massive.
- Yes.

Except now that I know the exact
composition of this cocoon,

I can scan the network
to find its counterpart.

Find it, find Tilly.

Help me! Help me!

Oh, no!

Shh, shh, shh. Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off!

Shh, shh, shh, shh. Ow! My eyes! My eyes!

Stay calm, Tilly.

You're okay. Don't you...
don't you shush me!

What the hell did you do?
What did you do?

Broke down your biological
form, transported it

across the dimensional plane,

and reconstituted it
here, in my home.

Oh, that old trick!
Are you freaking kidding me?!

I'm in the mycelial network.

It used to be a paradise.

No!

This is the one
I was telling you about!

Ow, it burns! It burns.

Leave her!

It's our process.

What does that mean?

The JahSepp... we
break down all matter

that enter the mycelial network
to make it useful in new ways.

Like the insects
do on your planet.

It's how we keep the
life cycle progressing.

This was you
before you were you.

That's what I am.

I'm appearing like this
to make you comfortable.

Comfortable?
You kidnapped me!

And I'm finding my way back!
You can't.

Watch me! Watch me!

And when I'm done, I'm not
gonna work through my anger.

I'm gonna let it sit there
and fester for eternity!

Please. I need your help.

You don't get to ask
for my help, May.

Then who are we to turn to?

Who am I to turn to besides you?

There's no one, Tilly.

And I can't fail,
or everything here,

my entire species, will die.

What do you need me to do?

k*ll a monster.

Burnham. Section 31's
liaison just got here.

Attention all personnel.

Security drill in progress,
deck four.

Burnham?

It's nothing, sir.

He's, um...

he's-he's just supposed
to be on Qo'noS.

He m*rder*d an officer.

Voq m*rder*d an officer.

Ash Tyler's a good man.

Even if I could see
my way to accepting

that distinction,
he left this ship

to serve as Torchbearer
for the Klingon chancellor.

Now he's into black ops.

I know Tyler.

Better than most.

Just like you knew
your former captain?

She certainly doesn't seem like

the Philippa Georgiou
I remember.

The war changed her.

Call me provincial,
but I prefer people

whose truth I can take
at face value.

So...

what truth are you
keeping from me?

Sir?

That moment you saw Tyler,

the moment that you had
your phaser on Georgiou.

I don't know you very well,
but I know you well enough.

It's a longer
conversation, Captain.

But I ask that you bear with me

until a more appropriate time.

Done.

Just don't make me chase
after you for the information.

Thank you, sir.

It's good to see you.

I feel the same.

Not sure shedoes.

Your captain thinks
I need a babysitter.

She's our new chief of security.

It's her job to be curious.

How the hell did you end up
with Section 31?

It's a very interesting
journey, actually.

Tell me.
- But it's classified... A word that pops up

pretty frequently
in my new vocabulary.

You always were
a man of secrets.

Michael.

I had to leave Qo'noS.
I'm never going back.

I think... everyone at 31
thinks of it

as a place
where they make sense.

Not in spite of who they are
but because of it.

They can be of service.
They're good people.

Like the Terran emperor?

I'm concerned for Spock's safety
as long as she's involved.

I won't let that happen.

I need you to believe that.

That's a really big ask, Ash.

I know.

I'm supposed to report
to the bridge.

Stamets is briefing us
on a plan to rescue Tilly.

Rescue Tilly from where?

Whoa. Whoa,
what happened here?

The creature destroys
everything it touches.

Wait, wait,
when did you first see it?

It arrived when your Stamets
opened the door to our world.

Doesn't make any sense.

No, careful!

The tree bark contains
a vicious toxin.

It's lethal for us.

Thank you.

The creature uses the toxin
to slaughter us.

We have no tools

or weapons to defend ourselves.

Well, you're far
from helpless, May.

The way you and I, uh...

I guess "met" is a funny word...
But it's some of

the most sophisticated science
I've ever seen.

I mean, you literally
entered my brain as a spore.

Thank you.

I appreciate your mastery
of science as well.

Let's go see
what we're dealing with.

But you...
you have to promise me

that you will get me
back on Discovery.

It's a little hard
to dive into this

knowing you plan on
holding me hostage forever.

There's a chance
Ensign Tilly is still alive?

There is, sir.

She was taken
into the mycelial network

against her will.

How do we get her back,
Mr. Stamets?

Every time we jump,

Discoverypasses through
the mycelial network for...

a few milliseconds,

and during that
very brief window of time,

we are actually inside it.

I'm proposing we do

a partial jump.

A predetermined course
with no set end point? Exactly.

Half in, half out
of the network.

Discoverywill hold
position long enough

for me to leave the cube
and find Tilly.

For us

to leave the cube.

You're not gonna do this alone.

Let's say I let you
use this ship as a doorstop.

Can we survive prolonged
exposure to the network?

The mycelia
will attack the ship,

decomposing it
as soon as we enter,

but tritanium is not
their favorite food,

so we'll have about an hour

before they
eat through the hull.

That's an hour
to find Ensign Tilly.

So far, I hate this plan.

It'll be critical

for everyone
to avoid places on the ship

where mycelial space
and normal space intersect.

Anyone who touches the barrier
will find themselves

twisted around the axes
of both environments.

Like the bodies we found

on the Glenn.

From what I know
of that young woman...

she'd put her life on the line
for any one of us.

That she would, sir. In a heartbeat.

Bryce. Open a
ship-wide channel.

All personnel,
this is Captain Pike.

Starfleet... is a promise.

I give my life for you;
you give your life for me.

And nobody gets left behind.

Ensign Sylvia Tilly
is out there,

and she has every right
to expect us.

We keep our promises.

This way! Quickly!

Move, move! Move! PIKE:
Please report to your stations

in designated safe zones
in the starboard section.

Let's go, let's go!

Good luck,

and Godspeed to us all.

Commander Saru modified these

to maintain communication
with the bridge.

They now have special filters
to limit interference.

The reaction cube is

the only place on the
ship where it's safe

to contact the mycelial barrier.

Stamets,

are you ready to execute
this very bold,

deeply insane plan of yours?

"Execute" might not have been my
choice of words, but...

that I am, sir.

Black alert.

Let's jump.

What's happening?

I don't know!

That's probably for me.

More havoc in my home.

The JahSepp have
never encountered

mass like this.

Please assure them,
this isn't an attack.

I won't assure them of anything.

I don't know
the humans on that ship.

But I do. And you know me.
You've been inside my head.

Trust me, we have
a much better chance

of defeating this thing
with what's on board.

You won't abandon us?

What are you doing
with your tiny finger?

It's, um... Just...

Pinky swear.

I told you
I would try to help you.

Where I come from,
we keep our promises.

We have to hurry.

Wow.

It worked.

Burnham to Commander Saru,
do you read me?

I'm here, Burnham.

Uh, the sensors show
the mycelium

have already begun
to attack the hull.

Move quickly.

Ready?

Hello?

Computer, report life signs.

Damn it, where is everybody?

Maybe they died
trying to save you.

Hey, thanks for that.

What was that?

The JahSepp have already started
breaking down the hull.

The monster has come here.
Why did it board the ship?

It pursues Discoveryevery time
you fly through the network.

Whatever it's doing,

I'm not letting it
terrorize my people.

They're my family.

Exactly.

Fall in.

That's soldier for
"Get behind me."

I'm reading a human life sign.

Section 14, weapons storage.

Why is Tilly arming herself?

Whatever you are, I'm holding
a type-three phaser r1fle.

It is more powerful

and generally larger than
the type-one or type-two.

Uh, which I guess is
why they call it a three.

Tilly?

Tilly.

Michael? Is that May?

Tilly, get down. No, it's not what you think.

She needs our help.

Are you...?

It's me. It's me.

I'm okay. I'm fine.

Thank you for coming to get me.

Always.

Restored to one piece,

atom by atom.

We're getting you out of here.

We have less than an
hour before Discovery's

irreparably compromised;
we need to go.

"Compromised"?
We'll be annihilated.

I told her I would stay.

There's-there's some sort
of predator...

A monster! A monster that is,

that is in the network, and
it's killing off her species.

Behind me.

This monster, May...
What can you tell us about it?

It started as a surge
of unknown energy.

We began to reconstitute it,

but it became this creature
out of our control.

Its skin

is indestructible.

We die when we try
to break it down.

Wonderful.

Hugh?

But he died.

This isn't real.

I thought I imagined seeing him.

Stay away!

Is this some
mycelial manifestation?

Have you, have you created this
from my memories...?

He's real!

What?

k*ll it.

Stand down, May. k*ll it. k*ll it!

k*ll it! k*ll it!
k*ll it! You promised!

Wait!

You let it go!

Burnham to the bridge.

We found Tilly.

How soon can you get back?

There's been a complication.

We won't survive complications,
Commander.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).({});

I know.

But something resembling
Dr. Culber is here.

Repeat that, Commander. BURNHAM: Dr. Culber.

Remember? Before you
came aboard, he... PIKE: I know who he was.

I need you to make it
make sense. BURNHAM: I can't.

Commander Stamets
went running...

Commander Burnham?

Michael?

Mr. Saru? I am working on it, Captain.

What if it is the
real Dr. Culber?

Nothing in the known universe
would make that possible.

Yourknown universe.

Dr. Culber was a healer.

He would never harm
any living being.

You refuse to see
what's right in front of you.

Look.

What is this?

Bark from the yeel tree.

It's deadly to us.

This was all over him.

He uses it to attack us.

He...

He's not using it to attack.

He's using it to defend himself.

Like armor.

Which would give him
motivational

and intentional thought.

Which means... he is alive.

Burnham, can you hear me?
BURNHAM: Yes, Commander Saru.

I hate to rush you,

but mycelia have penetrated
78% of the exposed hull,

and that number
is rising quickly.

We're trying to locate Commander
Stamets and Dr. Culber.

What's happening?

Do not worry about us.
Just hurry.

Red alert! Transfer helm control
to Airiam's station.

The hull of the port nacelle
is too compromised.

I need you to hold her together
under thrust.

This is Agent Tyler

transmitting on
secure emergency channel.

Control, do you read?

What the hell kind of
communicator is that?

Copy, Agent Tyler. Status?

Discoverycould use
an assist, sir.

Say no more.

Explain that to me.

Is that Leland?

Not his call, Chris.
We're standing by to assist.

I don't know what the hell
took you so long,

but we'll talk about that later,
at length.

Can you stabilize us
with your tractor beam?

Firing in three...

two... one.

Five minutes.

If this goes south,
I'm pulling Discoveryout.

That's not your call. You have one of my agents.

Captain Leland, please don't
risk the Discoverycrew for...

On my bridge, you will speak
only when addressed, Tyler.

And, Leland, my ship, my call.

You will hold
until I give the order.

Are we clear? LELAND: My engines are
about to overload.

We won't be able
to hold for long, Chris.

You're not real.

I am.

W-When I was lost here,
you found me.

Do you remember?

You found me in so many places.

You took me to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

when we were on leave.

It was our third date.

And-and you were walking so fast

because you were excited
to show me the de Koonings.

All of them in one room.

I had to run to keep up.

And as you walked, you held out
your hand behind you

because you knew
that I would grab it.

And I did.

And I knew everything
about you in that moment.

And I'm here now.

And here's my hand.

I thought I was losing my mind.

Dr. Culber?

Oh, no. May, no.
Oh, no.

Don't, please.
Don't do this.

Hey. Hey. May.
May, put it down.

I told you,

he's killing us.

May, look at him.

He's-he's trying
to protect himself.

It burns.

Everywhere they land on me.

May, you see him?

To him, you're the monster.

This is not who you are.

If you k*ll him,

it will ruin you.

Can I?

How...

How is he here?

When I was trapped
in the network,

I had moments of lucidity.

I saw flashes...

...as if I was moving between
this world and ours.

That's when I found him.

Hugh?

Hugh?

Hugh? No.

No! No!

No.

: No.
Please don't go.

Please.

I brought him here.

Thermodynamics.

Energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

It only changes states.

Even in death.

His energy passed through me

while I was the link
to the network.

Like a lightning rod.

When he took shape,

it-it could only recognize him
as a foreign body,

and it attacked him

the way healthy cells
attack cancer.

We have to go.

Now.Uh-huh.

All of us.

I'm taking you home.

The engines are overloading!
We have to disengage!

I'm shutting down
primary regulators

to buy us three minutes
and 30 seconds.

You realize
you're not in charge?

Even Section 31
has court-martials.

Would they court-martial you
if they knew what you did

six years ago on Deneva
to the wrong ambassador?

A minor offense, even
if it were provable.

If someone accessed the data
behind your firewall,

it would be easy to prove.

You may want to consider that.

Three minutes.

Try not to blow us up.

Such a worrier.

We've bought you time.

But not much.

Copy that. Owo,
prepare to disengage

tractor rigs. Mr. Saru,

they need to get a move on.

Hugh,

the cube is our airlock between
normal space and the network.

It's safe to cross here.

See?

I'm right here.

I can't, Paul.

I can't go with you.

Why isn't it working?
Why can't he go through?

His energy may have come
from your world,

but everything else,
everything we used

to build his body,
came from ours.

So what?
You brought me here.

You can, you can use the cocoon
to transport him there.

I-I moved you.

We did not create you.

Our matter is not your matter.

You're saying you can't
rebuild him out there?

I'm saying... I don't know.

I couldn't maintain my own form
without inhabiting you.

Paul.

The JahSepp can
reclaim my matter.

What are you doing?

You have to let me go.

Burnham, we are out of time!

Understood.

It's now or never.

I can't be the cause of this.

I can't leave you twice.

If you stay,

it'll be twice as deadly
for the network.

We'll find another way.

You're devoted
to creation, to life.

And there are a million reasons
to love you, but that's mine.

Please don't ruin that for me.

Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

May, you said
you couldn't rebuild yourself

in our world because you
don't have human DNA.

Right!

Right. That was the
missing ingredient.

The cocoon on our side is made

entirely of atoms
from the human world.

If you take Culber's DNA
and add it to the cocoon,

then maybe he... Maybe not.

Either way,
if we use the cocoon,

our door closes.

How many beings have lived
within each other?

I feel I know you
as deeply as I know myself.

I was gonna say that. I was just
worried it would sound weird.

It's not something

I ever thought
that I would have.

We have connected across
evolution and across species.

But when Commander
Stamets lost Hugh,

he lost everything.

And if we have a
chance to fix that,

we have to try.

I really believe
that the universe

will bring us
back together somehow.

You promise?

Promise.

Commander.

On our way.

Now, May.

I'll see you on the other side.

Burnham to the bridge.

Black alert.

Leland, now!

They're activating
the spore drive!

Out of the way!

Commander Burnham?

We made it.

Stand down red alert.

Mr. Saru,

have Dr. Pollard meet
the team in Engineering.

Mr. Tyler.

You'll stay on the bridge.

Liaison protocol.

Come on.

Paul?

Old friends
who don't shake hands?

You're a long way
from home, Admiral.

Indeed.

Starfleet has new and
critical information

about the seven signals.

The first one that appeared

led Discovery
to an interstellar asteroid.

But by the time you arrived,
the signal was gone.

We detailed a research vessel
to scan for subspace readings,

and the findings
were unexpected.

For a brief window,

the signal appears
to have left behind

a trail of tachyon radiation.

Tachyons?
Quantum field like that

could imply...
time travel.

Or it could be the by-product
of cloaking devices

or transporters.

You're both right.
Or maybe you're both wrong.

Either way, the only one with

any sort of connection to these
signals is Lieutenant Spock,

who's still a fugitive.

I need both of you to
find him, and I need you

to help each other.

Come on, fellas.

Cut the manlier-than-thou
bullshit.

Leland,

you camouflaged yourself

from a Starfleet
captain, your friend,

in the middle of
a rescue mission.

Admiral, our camouf... Save it.

And, Captain Pike,
Section 31 may not be

the shining beacon of righteous
conduct you want it to be,

but they are a critical
intelligence division,

and we have more pressing
priorities than debating

Article 14 of
Starfleet's charter.

Nation building is never pretty.

That is the unappetizing truth,

and you know it.

Now, I don't care

if you feel like
you are on opposite sides.

We are all on the same team.

We go back a long way, Chris.

But my job requires me
to walk a line, and...

I crossed that with you.

I apologize.

It's accepted.

I'll try to remember
that my path is

sometimes clearer than yours.

Well...

that's the understatement
of the millennium.

Now tell me what you know

about the shuttle.

Shuttle was a dead end.

Mr. Spock knows
how to cover his trail.

Burnham might know more about
where he'd be than she realizes.

I'll talk to her.

As we're working together,

I assume my temporary
liaison officer is permanent.

For the time being,

Agent Tyler is yours.

Unless you would prefer
Captain Georgiou.

Incoming message
from Captain Philippa Georgiou.

Put it through
to the science lab.

I heard you bought us
a few minutes.

Is that any way to thank
the savior of the Discovery?

I know you want to be paid back,
in spades.

Maybe I'm an altruist.

Maybe I'm a Terran.

In fact, you were.

Much more fun
than this Vulcan stoicism.

I really need to know
your intentions.

Toward Spock.

I want to find him
before a vigilante mob does,

or a posse of trigger-happy

Starfleet cowboys.

I'm pretty sure
you want the same thing.

There's just no world

where I could give that
serious consideration.

I've had your life
in my hands a dozen times.

You're gonna have to start
trusting me eventually.

Said the scorpion to the frog.

Have a little faith, Michael.

I envy those who can believe

there is a greater hand
writing our story,

who chooses the words
to keep chaos at bay.

Connection.

Joy.

Love.

And resurrection.

With these words, the path
becomes clear for a moment,

and then disappears.

If I have a path...

...I'm still searching for it.

We all are.

That's how we find our way,

by choosing to walk forward,

together.

And if there is a greater hand

leading us
into an uncertain future...

...I can only hope
it guides us well.
