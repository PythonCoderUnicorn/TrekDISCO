"A ship in trouble"
"making a forced landing, sir."
"It comes from"
"the Talos star group."
"Their call letters check"
"with a survey expedition."
"My name is Christopher Pike,"
"commander of"
"the space vehicle"
Enterprise.
"Our destination is"
"the Talos star group."
"Theres a canyon to the left."
"We can set you down there"
"completely unobserved."
"I think its time to show"
"the captain our secret."
"This is Vina."
"Her parents are dead. She was"
"born almost as we crashed."
"This is all some sort of trap."
"Are you real?"
"Perhaps they made me"
"out of dreams youve forgotten."
"Is there any way I can keep them"
"from probing my mind,"
"from using my thoughts"
"against me?"
"I cant help but love you."
"Lets get back"
"to the ship."
"I cant."
"I cant go with you."
PIKE:
"Personal log,"
"Captain Christopher Pike."
"Stardate 1532.9."
"Still no word"
"from Commander Burnham,"
"but I know she wont give up"
"until she finds"
"her brother Spock."
"As much as it pains me"
"to think the worst"
"of any Starfleet division,"
"I do hope she locates him"
"before Section 31 does."
"...is restricted"
"to all unauthorized personnel"
"until further notice."
PATAR:
"It is critical"
"Lieutenant Spock"
"be apprehended"
"as soon as possible."
"And by fleeing"
"with her brother,"
"Commander Burnham has committed"
"yet another act of mutiny."
"I accept full responsibility"
"for our security lapse."
"As you should."
"Spocks foreknowledge"
"of these signals appearing"
"around the galaxy"
"and his interactions"
"with the Red Angel"
"constitute vital intelligence."
"Are you tracking their shuttle?"
"We had a lock on its trajectory"
"for only minutes"
"before it was lost."
"Burnham disabled"
"her transponder."
"Shes smart. I expect shell"
"obscure her warp signature"
"to keep us from"
"regaining a trace."
"She cant hide forever."
"Spocks in need of vital"
"medical intervention."
"That limits their"
"potential destinations."
"Any chance of you"
"getting us a list"
"of off-planet Vulcan"
"medical facilities?"
"Controls threat-analysis system"
"will prioritize those."
"Any other"
suggestions?
"I believe that we should..."
"I was asking Captain Georgiou."
"Since you asked,"
"I would put out"
"a Federation-wide alert"
"for Burnhams shuttle,"
"but exclude"
Discovery.
Exclude
Discovery?
Why?
"We dont want"
"personal entanglements"
"complicating the search."
"If Burnham were to"
"reach out to anyone,"
"it would be Pike."
"Lets listen for it"
"but not tip our hand."
"Excellent observation."
"Captain Leland, you have an"
"agent on Captain Pikes ship?"
"Specialist Tyler is on board, yes. Good."
"Because if Burnham communicates"
with
"we need to know."
"Keep us informed."
"All of this reliance on"
"computerized threat analysis"
"bothers me."
"In my universe,"
"the artificial intelligence"
"took orders from me,"
"not the other way around."
Really?
"And how did that"
"work out for you?"
"Why dont you whip up a"
"good reason for"
"to stand down and relay"
"the orders to them,"
"since youre on a roll."
MAN
"Encryption protocol verification"
"has been ordered for all..."
"Well find Spock"
"and Burnham, of course,"
"and theyll have a lovely time"
"answering many, many questions."
"In the meantime,"
"since you"
"felt it necessary"
"to destroy that probe,"
"wed like you to comb"
"through the debris field"
"to find any remains that"
"could help us understand"
"what it was made from"
"and why it accessed"
"your computers."
"That kind of thing."
"Are you sure Commander Burnham"
"received the hails"
"from your ship"
"and that she deliberately"
"ignored them?"
"Why would I lie?"
"Michael always has a logical"
"motivation for her actions."
"Believe me,"
"I know her well."
"No matter how"
"you may feel about her,"
"she is aiding and abetting"
"a m*rder suspect."
"Who also happens"
"to be her brother."
"There are many different"
"approaches here."
"can be"
"a more valuable asset."
"value lies"
"in gathering more intel"
"on the probe."
"Oh, and if Burnham"
"checks in,"
"we need to know"
"immediately, okay?"
"Im really busy."
"All right. My tolerance for"
"discretion has worn very thin."
"What, exactly,"
"is your relationship"
"with Michael Burnham?"
"Its 100% professional, sir."
"And has that always"
"been the case?"
"Mr. Tyler,"
"you and I have been through"
"a lot together recently."
"Im giving you the benefit"
"of the doubt,"
"and Im asking that you do"
"the same with me."
"I was in love with Michael,"
"and she was... not entirely"
"disinterested in me."
"But I violated"
"her trust."
"I wasnt the person she thought"
"I was, so she... moved on."
"I apologize, Mr. Tyler, but..."
"Im responsible"
"for a lot of lives here."
"Your feelings could impact"
"our mission."
"They wont."
"Permission to be"
"excused, Captain."
"One of 11 planetary bodies,"
"Talos IV was a warp-capable"
"M-Class planet"
"with a thriving population,"
"until several thousand"
"years ago,"
"when nuclear war caused"
"a near-extinction-level event."
"A small population of"
"the indigenous species remains,"
"possessing susceptive"
"psychogenic abilities."
"Travel within the Talos system"
"is prohibited by Starfleet."
"Were approaching"
"Talos IV."
"Whatever it is youre"
"looking for, I hope we find it."
Warning.
"Now entering restricted space."
Warning.
"Shuttle entering critical orbit."
"Correct course."
"Computer, reverse"
"starboard impulse engine"
"and engage warp drive."
Spock!
"Its a black hole."
"Well be crushed."
"Structural failure"
"in five seconds."
"Four. Three."
"Two. One."
"Was that an illusion?"
"No, it was a test."
"Were really on"
"the other side of"
"the looking glass now,"
"arent we?"
"So, uh, not much"
"has changed."
"Should feel"
"pretty familiar."
"More or less."
"Anyway, I think"
"we should, uh,"
"take full advantage"
"of this opportunity."
"You wouldnt believe how much"
"personal time I have saved up."
"Yes, I would."
"You spent every"
"waking moment in your lab,"
"weekends, nights."
"Great, so, uh, looks like"
"your memorys fully intact."
"Thats good news."
"I was hoping"
"the first time you saw him"
"would be, uh..."
"I dont know, I..."
"Im just glad were together."
"Look, Im gonna make"
"a formal request"
"to have Tylers quarters"
"moved to a different deck."
"Theres no reason you should"
"have to see his face every day."
"Here we are. Home."
"Airiam, how we doing"
"on the datacore audit?"
"The probe used multiple"
"SQL injections,"
"but Ive yet to find"
"any compromised files."
"The list of facilities"
"you asked for, Captain."
"Thats more"
"than I thought."
"All right, start with the"
"Quiliam Station in Beta Quadrant"
"and work your"
"way around."
Quiliam?
"Thats a Vulcan"
hospital.
"Youre looking for"
"Spock and Burnham?"
"Georgiou made it"
"pretty clear we were"
"to concentrate on collecting"
"debris from the probe."
"And we are. The crew is on task."
"Ensign Tilly,"
"care to bring Specialist Tyler"
"up to speed"
"on our probe search?"
"Oh, yes, sir."
"Come into my office."
"Whats up?"
"Okay, so this is"
"your Class-C mid-embrace"
"with a very unpleasant"
"and time-traversing cephalopod."
"Whats that?"
"Like a squid."
"Here you are"
post-self-destruct.
"And so far, we have reclaimed"
"one metric ton of material,"
"all of which is"
"from your shuttle."
"There are no probe parts."
"How is that possible?"
"We dont know."
"Point is, were doing our job."
"If Section 31 wants us"
"to stay stationary, so be it,"
"but I wont ignore a crisis"
"involving my officers."
"Atmosphere: 18% oxygen,"
"75% nitrogen,"
"4.6% carbon dioxide."
Temperature:
"24 degrees Celsius."
"I need to take"
"a look around."
"Will you be okay here?"
Turn.
Slowly.
"Who are you?"
"Where I come from,"
"the one holding the phaser"
"asks the questions."
"Are you Talosian?"
No.
"Human, but a permanent resident."
Spock.
"Its me."
Vina.
"Dont you"
"recognize me?"
"Whats happened to him?"
"Who are you?"
"Im an old friend"
"of Captain Christopher Pike."
"Is-is Chris..."
"is he coming back, as well?"
"Are you saying Captain Pike"
"and Spock have both"
"been here before?"
"Well, in some ways,"
"Captain Pike never left."
"I was a crew member"
"on a survey ship"
"that crashed here"
"when I was young."
"Long ago."
"The Talosians put me"
"back together."
"Thats the easiest way"
"to explain it."
"Im Commander Michael Burnham."
"They welcome you, Commander,"
"and ask that"
"you join them"
"below the surface."
"Theyre speaking to you now?"
"Beam down with Spock"
"so they can"
"examine him."
"What do you mean,"
examine?
"You brought us here"
"because you knew"
"the Talosians could help you."
"Have you been in communication"
"with them?"
"They assure you,"
"your shuttle will be safe here."
"Coordinates, please."
"Computer, two to beam down."
Vina.
"Are you real?"
"She is very real."
"We apologize"
"for the difficulties"
"entering the atmosphere."
"Material illusionis our primary form of defense."
"Im beginning to"
"understand that."
"Do you only speak"
telepathically?
"We will converse in"
"the ancient way if you prefer."
"Can you tell me"
"why, exactly,"
"he risked our lives"
"bringing us here?"
"The Vulcan"
"is experiencing time"
"as a fluid rather than"
"a linear construct."
"Conventional logic"
"has not helped him"
interpret
"such an experience."
"He knew youd be"
"able to help him."
"He knew that conventional"
"medical understanding"
"would be useless."
"Should this variance continue,"
"he will lose his mind,"
permanently.
"What could have possibly changed"
"his experience of time?"
"It is easier"
"for us to show you"
"his thoughts than"
"explain them."
"But we require"
"something in return."
"The memory of what happened"
"between you and your brother"
"on Vulcan."
"We wish to view"
"the entire conflict"
"between the two of you"
"during childhood."
"The defining experience."
"The wound you inflicted."
"You want to experience our pain?"
"Why? For your entertainment?"
"This is how we understand."
"How we survive."
"Survive another way."
"Your brothers sanity"
"will depend entirely"
"on your cooperation."
"Its better not to"
"resist, Commander."
"They dive deeply"
"into our minds."
"Our hopes."
"Our memories,"
"our fears."
"Even our dreams."
"This is how they found me"
"after the crash."
"They gave me the choice:"
"to live the rest of my life"
"as I am"
"or as I was."
"You see? Theyre not"
"unnecessarily cruel."
"And even though this may just be"
"a projection, it..."
"...it feels as real as it looks."
"To reorder your brothers mind,"
"we must disengage him"
"from logic."
"But you must pay the price."
"We may watch you"
"relive your memory?"
Yes.
"But I need to see"
"my brothers mind first."
"Very well."
"It began the night"
"you ran away from our home."
"Deep into the forests"
"of Vulcans Forge"
"and its many dangers."
"That is when the Angel"
"first appeared to me."
"I thought it was a dream,"
"a premonition."
"It showed me..."
"...your death."
"I told Mother and Father where"
"I had seen you in the forest."
"They found you."
"The Angel saved you."
"She changed your fate."
"Years later,"
"it appeared to me once again."
"Another dream,"
"another premonition."
"I now understand its meaning."
"And where it must lead me."
"It guided me to a remote planet"
"and showed me..."
"the end."
"My mind"
"to your mind."
"My thoughts to your thoughts."

"Now you see."
"Dinner is served."
Computer,
"music, please."
"You kept all my things."
"Well, I-I thought about, uh,"
"sending stuff to your mom."
"I tried to pack it."
"It was too hard."
"I wasnt ready, I guess."
"Here, um, first course."
"Asopao. Your recipe."
"Is it good?"
"Yeah, I-I guess, its just..."
"Its just unfamiliar."
"Its your favorite."
"I have that memory."
"Its just, my-my"
"senses, my feelings"
"dont connect with it."
"Or anything, really."
"I-I think"
"wh-what youre dealing with"
"is-is a-a form"
"of neutralizing shock."
"Its not that simple, Paul."
"Its not a matter of identity,"
"because we know who you are."
"Or maybe thats just who I was."
"I-I think we should try"
"to normalize..."
"Whats normal about this?"
"You never put together dinner"
"in our quarters before."
"Im just trying to help."
"Ill do anything."
"Please tell me how..."
"I dont know what to do!"
"You keep ing me"

"You have no idea!"
"Look, uh,"
"losing you was-was the worst"

"Since I died."
"Say it!"
"Why are you so angry with me?"
"You know what, Paul?"
"Thats a good question."
"Mr. Tyler, this is my ship."
"More importantly,"
"this is my crew."
"I will not call off the search."
"I will not leave two"
"of them out there."
"Certainly not when one"
"is accused of crimes"
"I dont believe he committed."
"When were not"
"in our right minds,"
Captain,
"were capable of anything."
"I can believe that about you."
"Not about Spock."
"It doesnt matter"
"what you believe."
"31 believes hes a killer."
"You may find them first,"
"but you wont get to them first."
"Section 31"
"is watching you."
"Not just Leland and Georgiou,"
"but their whole operation."
"Do you think youre surprising"
"me with this information?"
"When Leland reaches Spock"
"and Burnham, he will bury them."
"search only"
"shines a light on her."
"What are you saying?"
"Trust Michael to find"
"the right way through."
"Ultimately, its the safer"
"choice for both of them."
"If you trust Burnham"
"more than Section 31,"
"why are you working for them?"
"I know they act in gray areas,"
"and I know"
"theyre dedicated people"
"trying to keep you"
"and every other part"
"of the Federation safe."
"After what Ive been through,"
"after what Ive become,"
"I can be of service there."
Captain,
"may I have a moment?"
"Walk with me."
"It appears someone on our ship"
"accessed the transceiver array"
"and sent out an encrypted,"
"unauthorized subspace"
transmission.
"Three of them, actually."
"Large bursts."
"Petabytes of data."
"An unauthorized"
"transmission? Where?"
"Unknown, sir."
"Not just anyone can"
"access that array."
"There must be some"
"trace of the sender."
"Well, if there is, sir,"
"we will find it."
Spock.
"You saw the Red Angel."
"First as a child,"
"then again a few months ago."
"Who is it?"
"If I knew,"
"we would not be here."
"I was asking rhetorically."
"Then at least ask something"
"I have never asked of myself."
"Can we have a better version"
"of this conversation?"
"Is there a valuable question"
"in your arsenal?"
"Yes. Do you actually think"
"the beard is working?"
"The barren planets..."
"Andoria, Earth."
"Is the Angel a time traveler?"
"The engineering"
comprehension
"necessary to build its suit"
"would suggest so."
"And some of the memories"
"it shared with me"
"have yet to occur."
"There was no one left."
"A possible future."
"One that could well be"
"determined by our actions."
"Yours and mine."
"Yeah, yours and mine."
"Spock, there is"
"so much that I..."
"No. I am not here"
"to absolve you, Michael Burnham."
"This is not about your feelings."
"Guess Im a fool"
"for taking that personally."
Agreed.
"I risked everything"
"to bring you here."
"It does not surprise me"
"that you see it that way."
"But it was I"
"who brought you here"
"to see what I have seen."
"How does my seeing help you?"
"I required someone who had"
"context of my timeline."
"Of me."
"So you required family."
"An interesting choice of words,"
"coming from you."
"Shall we continue?"
"There is a great responsibility"
"at hand."
"To serve the needs of the many."
"Im listening. Talk."
"An impermeable layer of energy"
"surrounding the suit."
"A quantum field"
"I was unable to infiltrate."
"Still, the thoughts I received"
"from within it were human."
Human?
"There was loneliness,"
desperation.
"You will need to see more."
"Our hosts will attempt"
"to safeguard your mind"
"if you continue."
"But if you need"
"to rest before..."
"No, I dont."
"Show me."
"Mr. Spock,"
"theres been an event."
"Signals in space seen"
"across the galaxy."
"The pattern is undeniably"
"what you previously described."
"And what you are drawing here."
"Theyre real."
"My vision wasnt"
"a hallucination?"
"Premonition might be"
"a more accurate word."
"Then the images I saw"
"in the mind meld..."
"these signals..."
"Somehow, you reported them"
"before they appeared."
"What do you think they are?"
"I believe they represent"
"an attempt to communicate."
"By whom?"
"Perhaps these signals"
"have appeared before."
"Somewhere else?"
"As a Starfleet science officer,"
"you would have been exposed"
"to a comprehensive"
historical...
"History will not provide"
"an answer to your query, Doctor."
"Instead, you should be"
"asking me..."
"how is it I can"
"remember tomorrow?"
"It was a mistake to come here."
"I must leave."
"Mr. Spock, leaving"
"would be premature."
"There are Section 31 officers"
"coming to transfer you"
"to a more specialized facility."
"Section 31?"
"Your mind is in crisis."
"The Vulcan part of you"
"requires time to heal."
"You are correct."
"Time most certainly has"
"something to do with it."
"What happened after that?"
"Section 31 thinks"
"you m*rder*d these people."
"I see your faith"
"in my character has not changed"
"since we were children."
"You are inside my mind,"
"yet you still need confirmation."
"Do you see m*rder here?"
"Im sorry."
"I dont expect you"
"to understand,"
but...
"it wasnt really me."
"It was Voq."
Yes.
"Bring him out."
"It doesnt work like that."
"I can find him."
"This must be allowed"
"to play out."
"Are you sure about that?"
"Stop it."
"Stop! Stop, you..."
"Bring him out!"
"I dont even know"
"who I am anymore."
"Who do you think"
"youre talking to?"
"You allowed the fight"
"to proceed?"
"Well, I believe the"
"confrontation was"
"a necessary and"
"unavoidable catharsis"
"for both men."
"But hardly an example"
"of by-the-book"
"conflict resolution."
"The Starfleet manual offers"
"no regulatory guidelines"
"for interactions"
"between humans"
"with Klingons grafted"
"to their bones"
"and a ships doctor"
"returned from the dead."
"Then, occasionally,"
"we have to make it up"
"as we go along."
"That is the situation"
"in which we find ourselves, yes."
"This is not intended"
"with any judgment, Mr. Saru,"
"but I suspect that,"
"before your own evolution,"
"you might have made"
"a different call."
"Perhaps, Captain."
"Given the unusual nature"
"of our circumstances,"
"Im going to overlook"
"the incident,"
"but this cant happen again."
"And please make sure"
"everyones aware that"
"we will not be settling"
"our differences with violence,"
"but with the uniform"
"code of contact."
"And that goes"
"for you as well."
"Understood, Captain."
Good.
Vina.
Vina.
H-How...
"Im not used to you"
"being afraid of me."
"Used to me?"
"Its a lot to digest."
"Theres something"
"I need to say."
"When you came to Talos,"
"Id been alone"
"for so many years."
"I never imagined"
"happiness or love."
"And when the Talosians"
"decided we were"
"unsuited for each other..."
"when you left, it was worse."
"Because I knew what Id lost."
"Ive thought about you-"
"us- often,"
"and wished that you"
"would have come with me."
"Chris, I didnt need to."
"Thats what Im trying to say."
"They brought you"
"back to me."
"Not the real you-"
"its illusory, of course-"
"but the part of you that"
"still lives inside of me."
"Weve spent a lifetime together."
"Im glad..."
"Im glad youre not alone."
"All this time, you kept me sane."
"Kept me tethered"
"to what I once felt."
"Even though I was never"
"the person you thought I was."
"You didnt deceive"
"anyone, Vina."
"I felt it, too."
"But youre here now."
"This is real."
"As real as it"
"needs to be."
"But the Talosians ability to"
"project illusions across space"
"is limited."
"And the farther"
"away you are,"
"the harder it is"
"to sustain."
"Theres someone you need to see."
Burnham.
"( =  || []).({});"
"Youre on Talos?"
"Can you see me?"
"Yes, Captain."
"I found Spock."
"He directed us here"
"so the Talosians"
"could show me his mind."
"The first thing"
"I need to tell you is"
"Spock is innocent."
"There were no murders."
"I didnt want to communicate"
"through subspace."
"Section 31 might have"
"traced our transmission."
"I know what happened."
"Georgiou reported"
"that she tried"
"to hail your shuttle"
"while Spock was on board"
"and you failed to respond."
"I took Spock to Captain Leland,"
"and he tried to use"
"invasive Terran technology"
"to rip his mind apart."
"But why? What do they"
"want with Spock?"
"My memories of the future."
"Spock... it is good to see you."
"Captain, I have seen"
"the Red Angel,"
"and it revealed the final"
"outcome of our current timeline."
"If we are to escape"
"what awaits us,"
"we must follow"
"the Angels design."
"What design?"
"Please, the window"
"is closing."
Captain,
"I never believed I would"
"ask this of anyone,"
"but I need you"
"to take me on faith."
"You must come"
"for us now, if you can."
"Chris, hurry."
"Were out of time."
"Hurry for your friends."
"Theyre counting on you."
"You should at least..."
"at least get your hand"
"checked out."
Why?
"I-I can feel it."
"And Im not letting anyone"
"fix things I can feel."
"Look, just come home and..."
"Its not my home anymore, Paul."
"That version of me"
"that called your quarters home,"
"that version of me is dead."
"And Im not going back."
"But is it because"
"you dont want to or..."
"because you dont know how?"
"What difference does it make?"
"Would you please"
"just move forward?"
"And let me do the same."
"I, uh..."
Okay.
"MAN Commander Stamets to Engineering."
"Engineering, status, please."
"Commander Stamets"
"is just getting"
"into position now,"
Captain.
"Whats our destination, Captain?"
"Talos IV."
Captain.
"Talos is in a restricted section"
"of the Alpha Quadrant."
"Yes, it is."
"Hit it, Airiam."
"The spore drive"
"just disengaged, sir."
"Whats going on down there?"
"It appears to be a failure"
"in the spore hub."
"Sir, Im seeing corruption"
"in duotronics."
"Corruption that seems"
"to have been"
"introduced manually"
somehow.
"Have there been previous"
"corruption issues with the hub?"
"Not like this."
"We run level-three diagnostics"
"on the entire spore drive"
"every ten hours."
"Someone deliberately"
"corrupted the system."
"Why the black alert?"
"We have to get"
"to Talos IV"
"to retrieve Spock"
"and Burnham."
"But our spore drive"
"has conveniently gone down,"
"and it wasnt an accident."
"You think someone"
"tampered with it?"
"Who? Who would do that?"
"Well, we might be able"
"to narrow down the list"
"by asking who had a vested"
"interest in keeping us here."
"And someone on our ship"
"has been sending"
"unauthorized, heavily encrypted"
"subspace transmissions"
"to unidentified"
recipients.
"I dont know anything about"
"unauthorized transmissions."
Odd.
"They were authorized"
"by your command codes."
"I sent nothing."
"To no one."
"Someone must have"
"spoofed my code. And"
"sabotaged the spore drive."
"You dont really think I..."
"Ive recently"
"learned that"
"Section 31 has accessed"
"invasive neurologic tech."
"Maybe they used it on you."
"Maybe you dont even"
"know youre doing it."
"That part of my life is over."
"Im sure I-Id know"
"if I did something like that."
"Im sorry, Tyler."
"I cant afford to take"
"your word for it."
"And neither can you."
"Have him confined"
"to his quarters"
"until further notice."
"Trust me on this,"
"if nothing else:"
"Section 31 will find"
"a way to track you."
"Thank you, Mr. Tyler. I agree."
"Set a course"
"for Starbase 11"
"at maximum warp."
"Aye, sir."
"Radio ahead."
"Say that"
"we need repairs."
"Aye, Captain."
"Maybe thatll throw off"
"any potential pursuers."
"Starbase 11 is two light-years"
"from Talos IV."
"Exactly why I want"
"Section 31 to think"
"that were going there."
"Well pick a point midway,"
"alter course"
"and then run silent."
"That should buy use enough time."
"I hope."
"Thank you..."
"for helping Spock."
"Im pretty sure"
"he would have died"
"without your help."
"will be here soon."
"There isnt much time."
"I owe them my memory."
"You dont want them"
"to force payment."
"Its awful."
"Ive shown her"
"all the memories"
"she needs to see."
"Yeah, well..."
"...now you have to share"
"one of mine."
"Its the price I agreed to"
"for your recovery."
"Michael, wait."
"Michael, wait."
"Where are you going?"
"Spock, Im a danger"
"to your family."
"Our family. No."
"There are too many Vulcans"
"who dont want"
"humans living here."
"Father knows the"
"separatists arent gone."
"Theyll come back"
"and attack your home."
"Our home."
"Well fight them."
Together.
"Its better this way."
"You deserve to grow up"
"somewhere safe."
"Safe is a relative construct."
"Safe has inconsistent meanings."
"Stop it."
"I am going."
"Then Im going with you."
"I dont want you with me."
"Dont you understand that?"
"You are my sister."
"My sister..."
"You... you are helping the human"
"part of me learn to express..."
"The human part of"
"you is so small"
"it wont make a difference"
"in your life."
"Why cant you get it"
"through your head?"
"I dont want a freak"
"like you as a brother."
"But I love you."
Love?
"Youre not capable of love."
"I am."
"No, you are not."
"You are Vulcan,"
"and you will always be"
"cold and distant,"
"like a moon somewhere."
"Youre not worth my effort."
"But you promised you would"
"teach me the ways of Earth."
"That maybe we could"
"live there one day."
"Dont you get it?"
"I dont want you in my life."
"Stop following me..."
"...you weird little half-breed."
"Spock, I didnt mean"
"any of those..."
"I am aware you were"
"trying to sever"
"our emotional connection"
"so that I would be"
"less distraught"
"by your absence."
"A primitive tactic,"
"but logical."
"No, it was more than that."
"The Logic Extremists"
"would have targeted our family"
"as long as I was"
"still in that house."
"I did not want you"
"to get hurt or k*lled."
"But I should have"
"tried something else."
"Anything else."
Spock,
"I am so sorry."
"In point of fact,"
"I am grateful."
"Your words showed me"
"how damaging"
"my humanity could be."
"No, your humanity"
"was beautiful."
"I was a child."
"You were a catalyst."
"In an attempt to"
"escape emotion,"
"to escape you,"
"I fully submerged in logic."
"But my bedrock of"
"logic, my constant,"
"has always been time itself."
"And now time has failed me."
"Logic has failed me."
"Emotion has failed me."
"I have nothing to build upon,"
"yet build I must."
"This could be"
"the defining moment"
"for multiple civilizations"
"and millions of lives,"
"and I am not ready."
"Are you more angry"
"with me or yourself?"
"Do not attempt to"
"psychoanalyze me, Michael."
"Better minds than yours"
"have tried and failed."
"Yet you chose me"
"for this journey."
"You value our connection."
"Perhaps the bedrock"
"of your logic"
"is this relationship."
Absurd.
"You are correct,"
however,
"on one matter."
"It was foolish to idolize you."
"And I regret it deeply."
Discoverys
approaching.
"There is another ship"
"close behind."
"They want you to know"
"youre in danger."
"The Section 31 ship"
"is hailing, sir."
"Tylers confined."
"They didnt find us through him."
"Answer them, Bryce."
"I know where youre going, Pike."
"Cut your engines immediately."
"Thats an order."
"Ill start following orders when"
"you start telling the truth."
"Or did you not think"
"Id find out"
"what you were going"
"to do to Spock?"
"Last warning, Chris."
"Stand down."
"Detmer, drop us in"
"over Talos IV."
"Owo, the second were in range,"
"start scanning for our people."
"Got them, sir."
"Beam them up, quickly."
"Copy that, sir."
"Achieving lock,"
"and beaming now."
And?
"Ive locked on"
"with our transporter,"
"but Im getting interference."
"Sir, Section 31"
"has a lock"
"on Burnham and Spock as well."
"Leland again, sir."
"Put him on."
"Pike, disengage your"
"transporter beam immediately."
"I cant do that."
"If one of us doesnt let go,"
"Burnham and Spock will be"
"ripped apart atom by atom."
"Is that what you want?"
"Because thats exactly"
"whats going to happen"
"if you dont"
"disengage your transporter beam."
"Mute screen."
"What do I do, sir?"
Captain?
"Let your friends go."
"Its the only way."
"Let them go."
"Let us all go."
"Trust me."
"Goodbye, Vina."
Owo...
"disengage transporter."
"Yes, sir."
"Theyve disengaged."
"Beaming in now."
"Do not move."
"You did the right thing."
"That will be noted"
"in my after-action report."
"Now, you and your crew"
"are to report to Starbase 11"
"and await disciplinary action."
"Leland out."
"You look exceptionally"
"pleased with yourself."
"Arent you surprised"
"Pike gave up so easily?"
"Thank you"
"for your insight."
"Now, this time,"
"Ill do the talking."
"Captain, I detect a shuttle"
approaching
"from the planet."
"Trying to"
"scan it, Captain,"
"but something is"
"blocking us."
"Should I hail them, sir?"
No.
"They wouldnt want"
"to risk answering."
"Let them in the shuttle bay."
"Mr. Saru, with me."
"Welcome back, Commander."
"What were you doing on Talos?"
"This will go easier"
"if you answer me."
"Or it can go harder."
"I beg to differ."
"Say goodbye, Spock."
"Goodbye, Spock."
"What is this?"
"Whats happening?"
Captain.
"Commander Saru."
"But how?"
"Talosian projection."
"Thats how."
"Greetings, Captain."
Spock.
"Are you all right?"
"Much better for seeing you"
"in person, sir."
"Even if we are only"
"riding into danger."
"Is that a smile"
"I see on your face?"
"I believe it is. Yes."
"Well, welcome to"
Discovery.
"Those Talosians tried"
"this trick with me"
"in the Terran universe once,"
"and I blew them"
"and their stupid singing plants"
"off the face of the planet."
"Well, you might have"
"told me about"
"the scope of their abilities."
"And miss seeing you explain"
"yourself to the admirals?"
"Oh, Leland, I wonder how"
"this will work out for you."
"Captain on the bridge."
"Spock, I need to hear"
"about this Red Angel."
"Do you know what it is?"
"A human, and nothing more."
"It appears"
"this person is attempting"
"to change the outcome"
"of our current timeline."
"And what is that outcome?"
"A future in which"
"all sentient life"
"in our galaxy"
"has been eradicated."
"By what?"
"Unclear, Captain."
"Well, we should sure"
"alter course"
"and get the hell out of here."
"In just a few minutes.Discovery"
"will become"
"the most wanted ship"
"in the galaxy."
"I dont suppose the Red Angel"
"offered you any advice"
"on how to handle a"
"situation like this."
No.
"But my limited"
experience
"as a fugitive suggests"
"only one course of action."
"And what is that?"
"We run."
"I cant ask any of you"
"to participate in what is"
"clearly an act of disobedience."
"Course heading, sir?"
"Does feel like"
"we should get moving, like, now."
"I think you have"
"the crew, sir."
"Helm, get us out of here."
