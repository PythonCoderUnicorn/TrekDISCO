"They're now in range"

"Aye, Captain."
"That ship is Vulcan."
"That ship is Sarek's."
"I recognize it."
"He assembled"

"task force to study"
"the seven signals."
"He might have"
"some news for us."
"He may want to discuss"
"something else."
"I reported Spock's"

"of the signals to Command."
"The information likely made"
"its way back to the ambassador,"
"along with the news that"
"his son admitted himself"
"into a psychiatric hospital."
"You didn't betray"

"You followed protocol."

"No, not yet."

Amanda?
"Please don't react."
"Spock needs our help."
"I could only turn to you."
"Will you make this human our new"
"fleet captain, too, Chancellor?"
"Perhaps we should speak in"
"their standard tongue, too?"
"Whatever language you prefer,"
"the truth remains"
"the same: the Torchbearer was"
"anointed by T'Kuvma himself."
"You mean Voq was."
"If you want whatever"
"this is as your plaything,"
"he belongs in your bed,"
"not here."
"He belongs"
"wherever I am."
"Just like"
"the allied Klingon houses,"
"our union is"
"what makes us strong."
"Your old way of thinking kept us"
"at each other's throats."
"Remove the paint"
"from your face, Kol-Sha."
"We are oneculture now."
"Your unionis an insult"
"to my son Kol,"
"and all our sons"
"who died by human treachery."
"This is no"
coincidence,
"those seven red lights"
"appeared from the sky"
"so soon after she took power."
"They are an omen!"
"Seven drops of blood"
"ready to rain down on us."
"Remove the paint."
"Your chancellor doesn't"
"get her hands dirty."
"That's the Torchbearer's job,"
"whether he be human,"
"Klingon or both."
"You know about"
"the seven signals?"
"Yes. Sarek informed me."
"People are anxious to"
"know what they are."
"Attention all cadets."
"Duty log has been updated..."
"Spock's connected to them."
"How?He left a log claiming"
"that he saw them long before"
"they appeared to the Federation."
"But until we can speak to"
"him, we have no answers,"
"and I don't know"
"what else to do."
"I have no new angles"
"to investigate."
"Except... the one"
"I'm giving you."
"I just came"
"from Starbase Five."
"I went to the psychiatric unit."
"They wouldn't tell me"
"where he was."
"They wouldn't let me see him."
"They wouldn't say"
"what was wrong with him."
"Thy wouldn't even give me"
"his personal effects."
"You're his next of kin, and"
"you're a diplomat's wife."
"So I did the only"
"logical thing."
"I stole his medical file."
"It's encrypted."
"Can you please open it?"
Mother.
Please.
"How was your walk?"
"I have dedicated everything"
"to your cause."
"The least your uncle could do"
"is acknowledge me."
"He and the rest of House Mo'Kai"
"believe in you."
"We have enemies enough."
"There is no need"
"to dream up imaginary ones."
"Kol-Sha is telling"
"council members"
"that you are advising me"
"to eliminate the"
"great houses entirely."
"My uncle is disseminating the"
"truth to counteract his lies."
"He looks at me"
"and sees a human. They all do."
"You should not care what anyone"
"sees when they look at you."
"On that subject, only"
"my opinion matters."
"Why do you insist on"
"speaking English to me?"
"I'm not a human, L'Rell."
"I'm a Klingon whose body was"
"changed to resemble one."
"If we expect others to"
"acknowledge my Klingon side-"
"accept me as the Torchbearer-"
"you must treat me like Voq."
"If you are Voq,"
"then want me back."
"Want me."
"You touch me..."
"and that intimacy,"
"to me, Tyler, feels like..."
...violation.
"Spock speaks highly"
"of you, Captain Pike."
"Now my daughter does, too,"
"so I know I've come"
"to the right people."
"Well, ma'am, that makes it all"
"the harder for me to tell you..."
"I can't open this file."
"If I did, I'd be in violation"
"of the rules,"
"and my mother"
"wouldn't like that."
"There is precedent"
"in Starfleet case law"
"for a captain to invoke..."
"Was she this bossy as a kid?"
"On Vulcan, we call it"
"persistent. And yes, she was."
"She learned that from me."
Hmm.
"Bryce, get me Captain Vela"
"on Starbase Five."
"Tell him it's high priority."
"Yes, sir."
Ah.
Chris.
"You and my Bisabuela Nena"
"are the only two people"
"in this quadrant still"
"communicating on screens."
"Well, your grandma sounds like"
"a smart lady."
"You should introduce us."
"Sorry I haven't returned"
"your call."
"Calls, Diego."
"I've been waiting for"
"an update on my officer, Spock."
"I'm sorry,"
"I can't give you one."
"His case is classified."
"I'm well within my rights as"
"his captain to get a prognosis."
"Even if that weren't the case,"
"Spock has information"
"on the signals I was assigned"
"to investigate."
"Starfleet declared my mission"
"priority one."
"The signals have nothing to do"
"with it, Chris."
"Your guy is wanted for m*rder."
"He k*lled three of his doctors,"
"then fled the starbase."
"Why isn't word out"
"about his escape"
"so that every starship"
"can be on the hunt?"
"Elements of the case"
"just got complicated."
"Some of Spock's files"
"are missing."
"We have no idea how."
"Rest assured"
"they've got people on it."
"Thanks, Vela."
"Pike out."
"It's not true."
"My son is gentle and kind;"
"he wouldn't do that."
"I agree, Captain."
"Well, that makes three of us."
"But I don't think the people"
"handling his case would concur."
"Our boy's in trouble."
"Whatever happened,"
"he needs a fair shake."
"We need to find him"
"before they do."
"Burnham, break into Mr. Spock's"
"medical file."
"That's an order."
"Lieutenant Spock's"
"intellectual abilities"
"and capacity for reason"
"are intact."
"Instead, his dissociation"
"appears acutely emotional."
"E.Q. tests and his current"
"disaffected state"
"suggest extreme"
"empathy deficits."
"I'll transfer the rest of"
"the files, and then..."
"we can decide the"
"best place to start."
"Your wheels are"
"already turning."
"Logic dictates"
"a few theories:"
"Spock didn't do it and"
"he's wrongfully accused;"
"or he did m*rder those doctors"
"in a mentally compromised state,"
"or in what he thought"
"was self-defense."
"Or...He did it because he's"
"emotionally compromised."
"Extreme empathy deficit"
"is code for psychopathy."
"I can't deny"
"that possibility."
"He didn't have"
"a normal childhood."
"Sarek wanted Spock raised"
"in the Vulcan manner."
"And any display of emotion"
"was strongly discouraged."
"And in order not"
"to confuse my son,"
"I began to hide my own."
"I was not a real mother..."
"I wasn't what he needed."
"You gave us love every second."
"It was different"
"with you, Michael."
"I gave you all my joy..."
"and my affection"
"that I was not permitted"
"to give to him."
"But Spock is half human."
"If he had been permitted"
"to embrace the feelings"
"that I know he has"
"inside of him,"
"it would've saved him from all"
"the trouble that he's in now."
Stop.
"Those images."
"Spock drew them."
"I'm sure of it."
"He must've..."
"done them when he was"
"in treatment."
"I thought that he left it"
"in the past."
"But it's back."
"What is it?"
"Your brother called it"
"the Red Angel."
"He started seeing it"
"when he was a little boy."
"It changed him."
"I'm sorry."
"I have to answer this."
Michael.
"Thanks for answering."
"Of course."
"Are you all right?"
"Is L'Rell?"
"For now. She's"
"still in power"
"but her opponents continue to"
"challenge and discredit her."
"It's volatile.How can I help?"
"The Federation needs to be aware"
"of the situation."
"If L'Rell falls,"
"peace falls with her."
"I'll pass it up the chain"
"of command immediately."
Thanks.
"I should go.Wait."
What?
I...
"I don't know."
"I like the beard."
"I heard, postwar, the Klingons"
"are growing their hair again."
"The rumors are true."
"How are you?"
"I've been dealing with"
"some things"
"regarding my foster brother."
"I thought I hit a dead end"
"but Amanda came and got me"
"back on track."
"Can you ship her over here"
"when you're done with her?"
"I'm feeling a little stuck,"
myself.
"You've got me, right now."
"I understood my role here,"
"to aid L'Rell."
"But I'm afraid I'm hurting her."
"I'm an easy target"
"for the old guard."
"What does L'Rell think?"
"That their opposition"
"is part of the fight,"
"and their ignorance will be"
"their downfall."
"You admire her."
"I do."
"It sounds like she feels"
"the same way about you,"
"and values having you there."
"Try to take her at her word."
"It's, uh, it's late here, so..."
"Take care of yourself, Michael."
"You, too, Ash."
Yeah.
"Greetings, everyone,"
"and welcome to Shadow Exercises."
"As Starfleet's future chiefs"
"and captains,"
"this is your opportunity"
"to build rapport"
"with a senior officer,"
"and see firsthand"
"what their duties entail."
"So let us begin."
"Look sharp, people."
"This is our future competition."
"Is that your captain?"
"Um, Ensign Sylvia Tilly, sir."
"Fully present and"
"utterly focused"
"on this very"
"important exercise"
"for which I am"
"all ears, Captain."
"Your dedication"
"is noted, Ensign."
"So, what should we do?"
"How 'bout we marry some folks,"
"even if they're not that"
"into each other, hmm?"
"Oh, very good, sir."
"Captain. I need your"
"authorization for this."
"I don't understand."
"That was funny."
"The captain of this ship"
"isn't funny, he's terrifying."
"You may be thinking of an old"
"captain, Captain Lorca."
"Was he shorter?"
"And blonder?"
"And much, much whiter? Because"
"that's who I'm looking for."
": 'Cause that's who"
"I'm looking for.PIKE: I'm ready if you are."
"He's not the man"
"I need to talk to."
"Hop in"
"the chair, Ensign.Yes, sir."
"Let's run a systems test."
"Where is the other captain?"
"Uh, a systems test."
"Uh, where?"
"Where? In the chair."
"Oh. S-Sorry."
"Run checklist protocol."
"Acknowledged. Uh, step one."
"Tilly, this is not right."
"My plan is falling apart."
"Calm down."
"I'm hearing considerably"
"fewer syllables"
"out of you than normal."
"I-I know the chair"
"can be intimidating,"
"but are you okay?"
"No. We are not okay."
"I want the captain."
"I want the captain.This is the captain."
"Ensign, what is going on?"
"Tilly, answer Captain Pike."
Tilly...
No.
"I'm not listening to you"
anymore.
"You tricked me"
"and you lied to me."
"I didn't lie. He's lying."
"He's an imposter."
"Shut up!"
"Ensign Sylvia Tilly!"
"No. I didn't."
"I'm sor- I w-"
"She drove me to it. I..."
"That doesn't make any sense."
"I'm s..."
"I'm not..."
"I'm not."
"I quit."
"You were spying on me."
"Your mind plays tricks."
"What do you have"
"against me?"
"Why do you stop speaking"
"when I enter a room?"
"You'll speak now"
"or I'll slit your throat."
"If you feel aggrieved,"
"take it up with my niece."
"It is not House Mo'Kai that"
"is keeping secrets from you."
"What secrets?"
"L'Rell will be angry"
"I broke her trust,"
"but I cannot keep this"
"from you any longer."
Behold,
"the son of L'Rell and Voq."
"I learned I was pregnant"
"right as Voq"
"was being transformed"
"into a human."
"I could not activate him"
"on Discovery"
"while carrying a child."
"The gestation"
"occurred ex-utero."
"That is why"
"it is so small."
It?
"Does he even have a name?No."
"I have never met"
"the child."
"The baby is a vulnerability."
"He's just a vulnerability"
"to you?"
"All these secrets and lies"
"to protect"
"a failed wartime mission."
"What did you gain, L'Rell?"
"You think your discovery,"
"made moments ago,"
"is somehow greater"
"than the pain I have lived with"
"all this time?"
"Would you have"
"ever told me?"
"I wanted you"
"to be able to return"
"to a human life"
"without obligation."
"You will not be here forever,"
Tyler.
"Why do say that?"
"With such certainty,"
"like you know who I am better"
"than I do?"
"I chose to be here."
"I'm committed"
"to that decision."
"Why did you call"
"Michael Burnham?"
"I trusted her to notify the"
"Federation that an insurrection"
"of the High Council"
"might be brewing."
"So she is the only one"
"you trust."
"That is the only reason"
"it was that"
"particular human woman?"
Yes.
"That is the reason."
"On my way home, I looked"
"into one of Voq's memories."
"You and he walked across the"
"ancestral cliffs of the Mo'Kai."
"The sun set."
"The sky dripped"
amethysts.
"Our love was greater than that"
"of Kahless and Lukara's."
"Voq thought so, too."
"When I stared down"
"at that baby..."
"his skin, the same as Voq's,"
"the distinction that made"
"him feel like an outsider,"
"that made his"
"life so hard,"
"I felt like I was looking"
"at myself."
"For the first time,"
"the two sides of me felt whole."
"I can't be Voq."
"I can't give you back"
"those memories of long ago."
"But I can promise you"
"a new love story."
"I am his father,"
"and I am"
"devoted to you."
"Let's bring our son home."
"The rest will come."
"When did it"
"first appear to him?"
"It appeared to Spock"
"the night you"
"ran away from home."
"The Logic Extremists had"
"bombed the Learning Center"
"and almost k*lled you."
"I don't blame you"
"for wanting to escape"
"from Vulcan to Earth."
"I didn't make it past"
"the outskirts of ShiKahr."
"I still don't know"
"how Sarek found me."
"He didn't."
"That was Spock."
"We were about to alert"
"the High Command"
"to begin a search effort,"
"and Spock walked"
"into the room."
"He was still"
"in his pajamas."
"His eyes were wide,"
"and he said"
"that the Red Angel"
"had visited him"
"and told him where you were."
"That's where Sarek looked,"
"and there you were."
"Sarek and I"
"always believed"
"that Spock used logic"
"to pinpoint"
"your direction."
"He might have known"
"what time you left,"
"how fast you were walking, what"
"direction you were going in."
"(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).({});"
"And we just wrote the vision off"
"as a figment of his imagination."
"But Spock never wavered."
"He said"
"that the Red Angel was real."
"I've seen this angel, too."
"It appeared to me on our"
"mission to the first signal."
"Were you the only one?"
Yes.
"And I wrote it off"
"as a trick of the mind."
"And I didn't get the sense"
"that it was nefarious."
"I cannot believe"
"I'm talking like this."
"I'm not even sure it was real."
"It is."
"What saved you"
"hurt your brother."
"That vision changed him forever."
I...
"I watched him withdraw."
"I saw him lose trust"
"in other people."
"I watched"
"his openness vanish."
"It wasn't because of a vision."
"It was because of me."
"My presence was a"
"danger to the family."
"If the Logic Extremists"
"couldn't get to me,"
"they would try to get to him."
"And he was my little shadow."
"So I had to wound him deep"
"enough to keep him away from me."
"What did you do?"
"The fact that you're"
"not saying anything means"
"that you must have hurt him"
irreparably.
"Which is why the four of us"
"can never get together,"
"which is why you're always"
"too busy to see each other."
"I'm sorry."
"I am sorry for what I did."
"What I thought I had to do."
"I've reached out"
"so many times"
"to make amends."
"He's not interested."
"But I won't give up on him."
"I will find him."
No.
"I will."
"He will not know me."
"He didn't know me either."
Uncle.
"No, no!"
"I've been awaiting"
"your arrival."
"Your son is handsome."
"But I thought"
"he could use..."
"a little color."
"I will hunt you down"
"and rip out your entrails"
"with my bare hands.Doubtful."
"The paint I begged you"
"to wipe from my face"
"was swimming"
"with sensor implants."
"They are a"
"listening device."
"I was only hoping to eavesdrop"
"on your political strategies."
"But I never imagined"
"I'd learn of this."
"The High Council"
"will not tolerate"
"this dishonor.Well, I think"
"they are more likely"
"to condone kidnapping"
"than harboring a spy."
"Your pet betrayed the council"
"to Commander Burnham."
"Did he not?"
"What do you want?"
"I'm willing to part with him"
"and let you flee"
"in exchange for control"
"of the empire."
"You will agree to"
"my terms and meet me"
"at your residence."
"Saru called down"
"looking for you."
"You all right?"
"What's wrong?"
"Have you been crying?"
"I asked first."
"Talk to me."
"I need a problem"
"I can solve."
"More than you know."
"Talk to me."
"Haven't I been punished enough?"
"What happened up there"
"was upsetting to me."
"I panicked."
Tilly?
Tilly.
"Don't ruin what we have."
"We're not defeated yet."
"After the dark matter hit me,"
"I s..."
"I started to see a..."
ghost.
"She's a girl that I knew"
"when I was a teenager."
"Her name was May."
"But she's dead."
"And the May that I knew"
"was really meek and, uh..."
"kind of goofy when"
"you got to know her."
"But this May"
"is different."
"She's, um... she's insistent."
"She's grooming me"
"for something."
"For what?"
"She hasn't said."
"Because you're ignoring me."
"And I'm getting scared."
"And we need"
"a new plan."
"I am losing it, Michael."
"She's wearing me down."
"I've been avoiding sickbay."
"But, at this point,"
"I don't know what to do."
"I'm desperate."
"And after today, I'm"
"never gonna make captain."
"Your eyes are dripping."
"'Cause I'm crying."
"She doesn't know what crying is."
"I've got to think."
"I'll be back to talk"
"some sense into you later."
"She left."
"How can she not know"
"what tears are?"
"That's impossible."
"Show me a teenage girl"
"who's never cried."
"You can't."
"I know."
"I'm a xenoanthropologist."
"And if May were a hallucination"
"pulled from your subconscious,"
"then she'd know that emotion,"
"because you know that emotion."
"So May is something, Tilly."
"But I don't think she's a ghost."
"Or a delusion."
"You said she appeared to you"
"after the asteroid shocked you."
"But why did it shock you?"
"I held a piece in my hand,"
"and I wasn't zapped."
"The dark matter component"
"of the asteroid,"
"it reacts when it's"
"in proximity to one thing."
Spores.
"You don't need"
sickbay.
"You need Stamets."
Sign.
"I am still your chancellor."
"You are the"
"Federation's puppet."
"Why is she such"
"a threat to you, Kol-Sha?"
"The female?"
"She's nothing but a..."
"that lies with a human."
"If that is the gravest"
"insult you can hurl,"
"you are even less"
"than I imagined."
"I know"
"I am nothing to you"
"once I have signed,"
"so be sure"
"to k*ll us both, Kol-Sha."
"The one left standing will be"
"the one who returns for you."
Enough.
"Yes. Feel it."
Paralysis...
"is spreading to your organs."
"But I will not"
"let you suffocate"
"until you've signed."
"Thank you for my ink."
"Now pass me that"
"pretty little finger."
Now...
"for my first act"
"as chancellor:"
"an execution."
Now...
"you can watch"
"your Voq die..."
"for good."
"What is that?"
"Why have you"
"been spying on me?"
"Don't be cranky"
"about it. We have to ensure"
"that she stays"
"in the chancellor's seat."
"Who's we?"
Emperor...
": You have me confused"
"with someone else."
"I'm Philippa Georgiou,"
"retired captain"
"of the U.S.S. Shenzhou,"
"now Starfleet"
"security consultant."
": Oh, children"
"are parasites."
Ungrateful.
Inconvenient.
"I had to find"
"someone else"
"to feed mine, or I would"
"have gotten nothing done."
"I will consider"
"that advice."
"Thank you for your help."
"Gratitude is"
premature,
"as long as the disemboweled"
"leader of House Kor"
"is splattered on your floor."
"He took our child,"
"tried to force her to abdicate."
"We were defending"
ourselves.
"Kol-Sha k*lled your uncle-"
"it's an eye for an eye."
"I need a word"
"with the chancellor."
"Every minute you remain here,"
"your councilors must reorganize"
"their tiny male brains"
"to rationalize why it isn't them"
"standing on the dais."
"They will assume that"
"all your decisions are Tyler's."
"He is a liability."
"Can you k*ll him?"
"I had to ask."
"He is a liability, too."
"You can't show weakness"
"when it comes"
"to either one of them."
"I will not choose"
"between the chancellorship"
"and my son and his father."
"I told you what"
"I am here to protect."
"I am not giving you a choice."
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you."
"I am sorry, too."
"But thanks"
"to Burnham's insights,"
"we are closer"
"to finding a solution."
"And... getting you back into"
"the Command Training Program."
"What about Captain Pike?"
"I am not familiar enough with the"
"captain to anticipate his reaction,"
"but I do know"
"that he has"
"a sense of humor..."
"and that he is fond of you."
"We should have results"
"in one second."
"I told you"
"he was shorter, blonder,"
whiter...
"There he is."
"Yes, he is."
"That's where he flies."
"What's going on?She's back and"
"she's pissed."
"Maybe at you."
"Please hurry.Stop talking"
"to him until I tell"
"you what to say."
"Just as I suspected."
"You are hosting a"
"eukaryotic organism."
"A fungus?Obviously"
multicellular,
"since it has"
opinions.Fungus.
"Don't you dare"
diminish...
"don't you dare"
"diminish me."
"Anyone who works"
"around the spore drive"
"is inoculated-"
"how did she contract it?"
"It's possible that"
"a spore evolved"
"a resistance,"
"like bacteria."
"And don't you"
"call me bacteria."
"Or it's a different spore altogether"
"than the ones we harvest here."
"When Discoveryescaped the"
"Terran universe, their spores"
"rained down on Engineering."
"If one attached"
"itself to you..."
"Hey, May."
"Is that her?"
"He's the villain. Don't"
"let him poison you against me."
"There's our hitchhiker."
"A multidimensional,"
"fungal parasite."
"Why does it appear to be someone"
"I knew when I was a teenager?"
"Brain manipulation,"
perhaps?
"These people are lying."
"I am not a"
manipulator.
"You're special, Tilly."
"You're my only chance."
"I need you."
"How do we get rid of it?"
"We use the attraction"
"between the fungal spores"
"and the dark matter asteroid"
"to suck her out of you."
"This might hurt a bit."
"If you think you"
"can destroy me, Captain,"
"you're in for a fight!"
"Security breach by unknown"
"alien species in Engineering."
"Engage quarantine protocol"
Alpha-Omega.
"Such was the dishonor"
"he brought."
"Secretly, he communicated"
"with the Federation."
"He told them we are disunited"
"and therefore weak."
"He betrayed us."
"Lest anyone think"
"my arrangement with the human"
"outweighs my loyalty"
"to the empire,"
"think again."
"The traitor slaughtered"
"a Klingon infant."
"My son."
"He would have assassinated"
"your chancellor"
"had Kol-Sha not intervened."
"The leader of House Kor"
"gave his life to defend mine."
"One house defending another."
"His sacrifice is"
"a lesson to us all."
"I, too,"
"have sacrificed."
"I will bear a child but once."
Now...
"you are my children,"
"as I raise this family"
"to greatness!"
"Do not refer to me"
"as Chancellor,"
"for I deserve a fiercer title."
"From this point forth,"
"you may call me..."
Mother.
"You synthesized our heads"
"down to their neural mapping"
"and genetic codes."
"This isn't your everyday"
"Federation espionage."
"What kind of organization"
"could pull that off?"
"This kind."
"Section 31."
"I've heard of black badges;"
"never seen one."
"We've settled into orbit"
"around Boreth."
"Are you sure you want"
"your boy to become a monk?"
"It's what L'Rell wants."
"And you?"
"To know where I belong,"
"and to whom,"
"and who belongs to me."
"My son will be raised"
"by the most devout"
"followers of Kahless."
"No one leaves the monastery,"
"and no one who doesn't belong"
"ever gets in."
"Not even his parents?"
"He'll never know me."
"Never know L'Rell, either."
"But he'll be safe."
"You should consider"
"staying around."
"Our command believes"
"misfits have merit,"
"so we keep busy."
"I'm surprised you call"
"yourself a misfit, Emperor."
"The freaks are more fun."
"Take us to warp."
"CONTROL values"
"his skill set."
"We would like you to work"
"on your recruitment speech."
"Don't give me notes."
"He's in."
