"Oh, no,"
"its not random at all."
"Its actually an impossibly"

"of... like, a slice"
"of the galaxys history."
"Its like this delicious slice"
"of galaxy pie."
SARU:
"We may suffer losses"
"along the way,"

"change from the Kelpien advent"
"of your"
Vahar...

"Thank you."
"With the loss of"
"your threat ganglia,"
"the cartilage that housed it"
"is reorganizing to accommodate"
"a new type of"
"keratin-based tissue."
"It looks like spikes"
"growing in like teeth."
"Does that sound right?"
"I would not know."
"Did you discover anything that"
"might affect me psychologically?"
"These are your neurotransmitter"
"expression patterns,"
"last year versus today."
"With you as"
"my only Kelpien specimen--"
"forgive the term--"
"its difficult to say"
"with certainty"
"what these changes mean."
"But if I had to guess,"
"Id say your fear responses"
"are being repressed."
"SARU:What is a Kelpien without fear?"
"I am losing the very thing"
"that defines me."
"I am stumbling in the dark."
"And yet I cannot help but feel"
"that somewhere"
"within the unknown,"
"there is purpose."
"And that we are being"
"guided toward it."
TYLER:
"Its Section 31s position"
"that if the entity"
"were calling the Red Angel"
"is in fact generating"
"these signals,"
"its also capable"
"of time incursions."
"And should be"
"considered dangerous."
"So far, these signals"
"have led the"
Discovery
"on two rescue missions."
"Or two catastrophic events."
"Does the Angel merely appear"
"at these crisis points,"
"or is it creating them?"
"We have to consider"
"both options."
"So lets consider."
"The Red Angel appeared on Earth"
"and transported people"
"to Terralysium"
"only moments before"
"they would have died"
"in a nuclear blast."
"It also guided Spock"
"to rescue me when I was"
"a child on Vulcan."
TYLER:
"Ive seen the drawings"
"from Spocks time"
"in the psychiatric unit."
"Look, can either of you"
"say for sure"
"this thing didnt cause"
"his nervous breakdown?"
"Spock made no mention"
"of the Red Angel"
"when he asked for leave"
"from the"
Enterprise.
"But Agent Tylers"
"correct, Captain."
"With so few data points,"
"it is impossible"
"to draw conclusions based"
"on its nature and motivations."
"We need more"
information.
"What we need is Spock."
TYLER:
"Captain Leland"
"has devoted significant"
"Section 31 resources"
"to finding him."
"But were coming up"
empty-handed.
"As his sister,"
"can you think of anywhere"
"Spock might have gone?"
"Someplace we might not"
"have thought to look?"
"SARU (over comm):"
Captain,
"you are needed on the bridge."
"What is it?"
"We have detected a new signal."
"Where is it this time?"
"Outside of Federation space."
Ah.
OWOSEKUN:
"Acquiring coordinates."
"On screen."
"We have a lock, sir."
"The signal is over"
"an M-class planet."

"Kaminar is populated"
"by two sentient species:"

"and the Baul."
"The Baul are your predators."
"The Baul achieved warp"

"The USS"
Archimedes
made
"first contact with them"
"after receiving"
"a transmission from Kaminar."
"But once communication"
"was established,"
"the Baul High Council"
"proved hostile."
TYLER:
"So why did the Baul send"
"a transmission"
"in the first place?"
They...
"did not."
"That transmission was from me."
"I coopted"
"the Bauls technology"
"in order to send a message,"
"with the hope"
"that someone, somewhere,"
"would receive it."
"And that someone"
"was Captain Georgiou."
SARU:
"She was a lieutenant then,"
"serving on the"
Archimedes.
"Were it not for her,"
"I would have been unable"
"to flee Kaminar"
"or be granted asylum."
"I promised never to return."
"That was the price of knowledge."
PIKE:
"And now,"
"of the billions of planets"
"in our galaxy, the"
"signal just happens"
"to show up above the homeworld"
"of my first officer."
"What are the odds?"
"It certainly isnt random."

"Could be"
"its returning the favor."
TYLER:
"Thats a leap."
"Commander Saru,"
"are there angels"
"of any sort in Kelpien culture?"
"Kelpiens believe only"
"in the Great Balance,"
"which, if upset, would devastate"
"the fragile ecosystem"
"of our planet."
"And we are taught that the Baul"
"are the keepers of this balance."
"Do the Kelpiens worship"
"the Baul?"
"It is their superior technology,"
"of which Kelpiens live in awe,"
"that allows the Baul mastery"
"over my people."
"They hide behind it."
"No Kelpien has even seen"
"a Baul in living memory."
BURNHAM:
"It is the same technology"
"they use to keep"
"Starfleet at arms length."
"So we shouldnt expect"
"a warm welcome."
"The Baul are, by nature,"
isolationist.
"And theyre committed"
"to preserving"
"the status quo on Kaminar."
TYLER:
"Well, they must have seen"
"the signal, too."
"Maybe they wouldnt mind an"
"offer to share information."
"Depending on"
"how theyre approached."
"Well, lets knock on the front"
"door and see if they answer."
"And then what? Just ask nicely?"
"Well, as unexpected guests,"
"it never hurts to be polite."
"(indistinct chatter)"
MAN:
"Prepare to disengage"
"warp power."
DETMER:
"Sir, stopping out of"
"warp above Kaminar."
"The signal disappeared"
"before we arrived."
"What else is new?"
"Mr. Bryce, hail the Baul"
"on all channels."
"Commander Burnham, run planetary"
"and full-spectrum scans"
"on anything resembling"
"our elusive angel."
"And any power source capable"
"of generating these signals."
"The Baul are not"
"responding, sir."
"Thats not entirely true, sir."
"Theyre scanning"
"our weapons systems."
"Just our weapons systems."
"So much for knocking"
"on the front door."
"PIKE: Maybe the Baul just"
"havent learned the importance"
"of a good first impression."
Burnham?
"I see no indication"
"the Red Angel was here."
"Or any immediate danger"
"to the planet."
"Then why are we here? Anybody?"
"Youre assuming the signals"
"only appear for a reason."
"Yes, Mr. Tyler, thats"
"exactly what Im assuming."
"Why wont the Baul respond?"
SARU:
Perhaps,
"as I have said, it is"
"because they are oppressors."
"And even had the Baul"
"answered our hails,"
"why would you trust those"
"who have enslaved my people"
"for centuries"
"with fear and lies?"
PIKE:
"Your insights"
"are invaluable,"
"Mr. Saru."
"But the signal appeared here."
"And maybe the Red Angel, too."
"If you have any idea how I could"
"make inquiries without..."
"There is a Kelpien priest"
"in every village."
"Priests not only serve"
"as intermediaries"
"between us and the Baul,"
"but they also connect"
"all of our extended"
"communities together."
"So if the Red Angel"
"appeared on Kaminar,"
"then a priest might be able"
"to tell us about it."
"Wouldnt that be a violation"
"of General Order 1?"
"BURNHAM: Though the Kelpiens"
"arent warp capable, theyve"
"seen warp-capable technology"
"through the Baul,"
"and they know about spaceflight."
"First contact with the Kelpiens"
"by Starfleet"
"is a judgment call,"
"but our mission"
"to investigate these signals"
"would seem to require it."
"We can stretch"
"General Order 1,"
"but lets try not to break it"
"in the process."
Burnham,
"as a xenoanthropologist,"
"I think youre"
"uniquely qualified"
"to talk"
"to a village priest."
SARU:
Sir,
"I am the logical choice."
"I offer my experience."
"To disregard it"
"is to disregard the suffering"
"of generations of Kelpiens."
PIKE:
"Given all that suffering,"
"youre the most"
"complicated choice."
"Do you doubt my ability"
"to carry out the mission?"
PIKE:
"Of course not."
"But at present, we lack"
"a full understanding"
"of the biological..."
"and behavioral changes"
"youre undergoing."
"I can assure you, Captain,"
"I am still very much myself."
"I can only imagine the pressure"
"you might feel to share"
"the truth with your people"
about
Vaharai.
"Are you suggesting"
"that I might be incapable"
"of following Starfleet"
regulations?
"Or that I would"
"disobey your orders?"
Captain.
"Kelpiens have no knowledge"
"of Starfleet"
"or any other"
"inhabited worlds."
"Even though General Order 1"
"allows contact,"
"my arrival could come as"
"a complete shock to them."
"Commander Saru would be"
"invaluable to have by my side."
"All right."
"But Ill remind you both, were"
"here to gather information"
"about the signals"
"and the Red Angel,"
"not start a war between"
"the Kelpiens and the Baul."
"Mr. Saru?"
"My duty, first and foremost,"
"is to"
Discoverys
"mission, sir."
"I never doubt that."
"Start in your"
"own village."
"Maybe theyll be"
"glad to see you."
CULBER:
"So, uh,"
"what did the scan say?"
"Read em yourself."
"All normal."
"Youre you."
POLLARD:
"Yes and no."
"Brain patterns and neural"
"impulses are identical,"
"but this body"
"was entirely reconstituted"
"from your DNA."
"Its brand-new down to the"
"last molecule. You are,"
"for lack of a better word,"

"My scar, its gone."
STAMETS:
"It is?"
"I hadnt noticed that."
"What scar?"
"Oh, the scar"
"he chose to keep."
"You never told her"
"the story?"
"He was hiking the cliffs"
"of Cabo Rojo, alone."
"I was 16..."
STAMETS:
"And apparently indestructible."
"The path he"
"was on gave way,"
"and he fell 30 meters."
"15, actually."
"Well, enough to puncture"
"your shoulder."
"He wouldve bled out, too,"
"if it werent for a"
"certain Dr. Kashkooli,"
"who was half a"
"kilometer behind him."
"She risked her own life"
"to climb down and help him."
"She stitched his wound up"
"with a fishing line."
"Gave him a very"
"sexy scar"
"and inspired him to go"
"to medical school"
"and become the man he is today."
"It is weird not"
"seeing it on you."
"So, um..."
"...i-if my senses feel"
"a little off, its..."

"It isnt Kelpien,"
"is it?"
No.
"The Baul have erected one"
"in each village to observe us."
"It has earned them a fitting"

"the Watchful Eye."
"This pylon is connected"
"to an incredibly vast network."
"Must have taken"

"to integrate their"
"technology and ideology"
"into Kelpien society."
"Our two species have become"
"so intertwined that,"

"I led this life once."
"If I didnt know"

"Id think Kaminar"
"was a paradise."
"Well, in many ways, it is."
"We live in harmony"

"in a world without"
"hunger or poverty."
"The only violence we"
"know is the culling,"
"which Kelpiens have"
"been misled to accept"
"as a mercy"
"by the Baul."
"And our priests"
"sustain that belief."
"Didnt you say"
"your father was a priest?"
"Yes, he was"

"enforcing the grip"

BAUL:
"The first Kelpien"
"to pass its"
Vaharai
"in over 2,000 years,"
"and your primal, feral responses"
"are the same as centuries ago."
"Your kind can never govern"
itself.
"The Federation has no idea"
"what they have welcomed"
"into their ranks."
"They gave me the chance"
"stolen by the Baul."
"Your species does not deserve"
"a second chance."
"The Great Balance"
"is the only way to ensure"
"you do not destroy"
"everything in your path."
"The Great Balance is a lie"
"you created"
"to defend yourselves from us,"
"and to absolve yourselves"
"of m*rder."
"In truth, you are frail."
"You would be helpless"
"without your technology."
"We will never allow"
"the past to be repeated."
"No threat to the Great Balance"
"will go unanswered."
"You cannot maintain"
"what you think of as peace"
"by continuing to cull us."
"Kelpiens are more"
"than our instincts."
"You are the only two Kelpiens"
"to know the truth."
"You will undergo analysis"
"and be neutralized."
"The truth will be contained."
Wait!
(groaning)
"No, please, stop!"
Siranna!
(grunting)
(panting)
"It is true, then."
"You have survived"
Vaharai?
Yes.

"I am what we"
"used to become."
"The form we were meant to take."
"The Great Balance..."
"our sacrifice"
"to the Watchful Eye..."
"It was all a lie."
"Forced upon us by the Baul."
"That stole our mother and father"
"from us."
"And generations of Kelpiens,"
"beyond reckoning."
"And it must end."
"The Baul used their"
"technological advantage"
"to lock the Kelpiens"
"into subservience,"
"allowing them to live"
"while eliminating the threat"
"they posed."
"And thats why"
"the Baul are afraid."
"Well, if we can"
"help them understand"
"that Saru is not a threat,"
"that his people"
"need not be a threat..."
BRYCE:
"Sir, were receiving a hail..."
"from the Baul."
"We should accept it."
"(static crackling)"
Discovery,
"this is Commander Saru."
"Its good to hear your voice,"
Commander.
"I am with Siranna,"
"inside a Baul structure."
"But we have no"
"other indicators"
"of our position."
"We cant seem to get a lock"
"on your coordinates either."
"Your location must be shielded"

"Have you come in contact"
"with the Baul?"
"Yes. It was..."

BURNHAM:
"Commander Saru,"
"we used the"
"Spheres archives"
"to analyze your"
"planets history,"
"and its far more complex"
"than we thought."
"All evidence indicates that"
"Kelpiens, in"
post-Vaharai
form,
"were once the Bauls predators."
"That confirms"
"my suspicions."
"And the Bauls"
"belief that,"
"after passing"
Vaharai,
"my people can"
"only be predators."
"They will do anything"
"to continue the culling."
"And to keep more Kelpiens"
"from learning the truth."
"It will not be easy"
"to convince my people"
"the Great Balance"
"is a deception,"
"but we must find"
"a way to save them."
"Thousands of years"
"of conditioning"
"will take time to undo."
SARU:
"But Siranna is right."
"We must demonstrate to Kelpiens"
"and Baul alike"
"what we could become."
"The same way I was shown."
TILLY:
"The Sphere."
"The Sphere triggered"

Vaharai.
"Yes, but we need to"
"accelerate the process."
"We cannot allow the Baul"
"to take action before"
Vaharai
"is complete for all Kelpiens."
"If we isolate"
"the active frequencies"
"in the Spheres transmission,"
"the corresponding sound wave"
"should speed up"
"the biological response, right?"
"I got it."
SARU:
"And the Baul"
"will have no choice"
"but to face our evolved race."
"What if history repeats itself?"
"We cant be responsible for the"
"extinction of the Baul species."
"But the Baul are still vastly"
"technologically superior."
"It would take the"
"Kelpiens generations"
"to become a serious threat."
"Generations during which"
"the Baul could face"
"the thing they fear"
"most about us."
"Not our so-called"
"baser instincts."
"Our rage."
"But we will prove to them"
"that we can move beyond it."
"We will not perpetuate"
"the cycle."
"We will create"
"a new balance."
"Captain, I cannot prove it,"
"but I believe this is what the"
"signal brought us here to do."
"Very well, Commander."
Discovery
"will help you"
"amplify the signal."
BURNHAM:
"How will we broadcast"
"the Spheres transmission"
"to all the Kelpiens at once?"
"The same way I made"
"first contact"
"with Captain Georgiou."
"By using the Bauls own"
"technology against them."
"That should do the trick."
"Commander Saru,"
"Im sending you the modified"
"Sphere transmissions now."
"Once I do this,"
"all Kelpiens, including"
"you, will begin"
Vaharai.
"Everything will change."
"Im afraid itll be"
"much more painful,"
"like being torn"
"apart from within."
"Just promise me, brother,"
"that this will not be"
"the end of our people."
"No. It will be a new beginning."
"Then let it begin."

"A Baul stronghold."
"Protected by a powerful"

"That might be where"
"theyre holding"

captive.
"Red alert. Rhys, target"

"If we destroy them,"

"(breathing normalizing)"
"You have survived."
"(deep bellowing)"

"We have angered the Baul."
"(alarm sounding)"
"Owosekun, tell me"
"what Im looking at."
"That Baul structure is"
"activating pylons"
"across the planet,"
"with an energy buildup"
"capable of destroying"
"every Kelpien village."
"Rather than let"
"them evolve,"
"the Baul are"
"committing genocide?"
"Bryce, hail these bastards."
"Rhys, forget the stronghold."
"Get a target lock"
"on those pylons."
"Theyre not responding, sir."
"Open a channel."
"This is Captain Pike."
"I will not allow you"
"to wipe out an entire race."
"Your fear of the Kelpiens"
"has blinded you"
"to a peaceful solution."
"Starfleet can help you"
"negotiate a new balance"
"between your two species,"
"protecting everyone"
"on your world."
"However, if you choose"
"to m*rder the entire"
"Kelpien population..."
"...you will become our enemies."
"Choose wisely."
"Sir, theyve activated"
"all 4,056 pylons"
"in every Kelpien village."
"Lieutenant Rhys?"
"There are too many pylons"
"to target at once, sir."
"Lets get started."
"Arm photon torpedoes."
"On my order."

"The Baul mean to k*ll us all!"
Discovery
"will stop them."
"No, no!"
"(powering down)"
"Sir, sensor readings"
indicate
"a massive spike in"
"electromagnetic radiation"
"in the Baul structure."
"The pulse has deactivated"
"all the pylons across Kaminar."
"Rhys, hold your fire."
"What the hell"
"is happening?"
"The Baul weapons and shields"
"have all been disabled,"
"but I cant get a reading"
"on what caused it."
DETMER:
"The technology required"
"to generate"
"electric and magnetic fields"
"that wide..."
"This should be impossible."
"(both breathing heavily)"
"That is what you came to find."
"A savior."

Vaharai?
"The truth has survived."

"Whats this?"
"Commander Sarus report,"
"shared in the spirit"
"of cooperation."
"Thanks to Commander Sarus"
"enhanced eyesight,"
"he was able to get a better look"
"at the Red Angel."
"The entity appears
to be a humanoid

wearing a"
"mechanized suit,"
"exhibiting technology
far beyond

present Federation
capabilities."
"So, its"
someone.
"And whether human"
"or alien,"
"it has extremely"
"advanced technology."
"Someone who is manipulating"
"the fates of entire species."
Control,
"which models Section 31s"
"threat assessments,"
"is probably rightfully"
"alarmed by..."
"what is it? A..."
"a time-traveling being"
"pursuing its own agenda?"
"When we forced the Baul"
"to decentralize their power"
"across the entire planet,"
"the Red Angel took advantage"
"of their temporary exposure"
"and used its advanced technology"
"to save the Kelpiens"
"from genocide."
"And what happens"
"when that technology"
"is turned against us?"
"Section 31..."
"and Controls"
"threat-assessment models..."
"seem a bit paranoid."
"Youre aware were"
"no longer at war?"
"And we dont want to"
"end up in one again."
"This last war, sir, took a toll"
"on those who fought it."
"Some of us are still torn apart."
SARU:
"I felt the same way"
"the first time I saw it,"
"looking down on our"
"planet, our home."
"Well, you took home"
"with you."
"Well, seeds of it, yes."
"This little garden was"
"all I had for so many years."
"But I realized"
"there was so much"
"more out there."
"You could come with me, Siranna,"
"if you wanted to see it."
"Just for a while."
No.
"I must stay for my people."
"There is a long road ahead,"
"Our minds must truly be free"
"before Kelpien and Baul"
"accept each other."
"(clicks tongue)"
"But I am happy, brother."
"I know you did not"
"leave Kaminar in fear,"
"but in hope."
"And you brought that hope"
"back with you."
"You and your Red Angel."
"You are welcome"
"to return home"
"whenever you would like,"
brother.
"I will, sister."
(gasps)
(sighs)
"Thank you, Michael."
"Im reminded."
"Do you know Aeschylus?"
"An ancient Greek tragedian,"
"born circa 525 BC."
"He who learns must suffer.

And even in our sleep..."
"Pain that cannot forget

falls drop by drop
upon the heart."
"Knowing that my sister"
"has a chance to evolve,"
"to live a full life,"
"it makes me feel I"
"can endure anything."
"I am sure, given"
"the opportunity,"
"you would do the same"
"for your own brother."
"If I could find him."
"But seeing you with Siranna"
"has made one thing"
"very clear to me."
"And that is?"
"I need to go home as well."
"To Vulcan."
