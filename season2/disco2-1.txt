Last season
onStar Trek: Discovery...

This is mutiny.Move, Saru. Fire.

Stand down.

Captain, incoming.

Warp signatures detected.

No!

For the charge of mutiny,

it is our ruling
that the defendant

be stripped of rank
and hereby sentenced

to imprisonment for life.

You helped start a war.

Don't you want
to help me end it?

We will be able
to materialize anywhere

in the known universe. That's
how you beat the Klingons.

Only one more jump.

We are in a parallel universe,

one governed
by the Terran Empire.

Don't you bow
before your emperor?

My so-called captain's
not from my universe.

He's from yours.

Klingons are on the verge

of wiping out the Federation.

We do not have the
luxury of principles.

That is all we have, Admiral.

Do we need a mutiny today

to prove who we are?

We are Starfleet.

The war is over.
There were triumphs.

Victories of spirit.

Courage beyond reason.

These were bleak times,

times we cannot forget.

We will not allow desperation

to destroy moral authority.

That is the United Federation
of Planets.

Captain on the bridge.

Actingcaptain.

Please take your stations.

Lieutenant Detmer,

set course for Vulcan and engage

at maximum warp.Aye, sir.

Incoming transmission.

Identify the source, please.

I'm getting
the Federation ID code.

I-It's choppy.

Trying to clean it up, sir.

Helm, slow us down.

Dropping us out
of warp now, sir.

Hail is from Captain Pike, sir.

It's the USS Enterprise.

Space.

The final frontier.

Above us.

Around us.

Within us.

We have always looked
to the stars

to discover who we are.

A thousand centuries ago
in Africa,

the ÷¦Xam Abathwa tribe gathered to share a story.

The tale of a girl who dug
her hands in the wood ash

and threw it into the sky
to create

the Milky Way.

And hidden there,

a secret buried
among the eternal stars,

was a message.

An enormous letter in a bottle
made of space and time,

visible only to those
whose hearts were open enough

to receive it.

A child has come to us.

She's human.

She is orphaned.

It is our responsibility.

What happened to her parents?

The unthinkable.

My name is Amanda.

What's yours?

Michael.

I bless you, Michael.

All my life.

Do you want to meet our son?

When I first heard the story

of the girl who made the stars,

I wasn't ready to understand.

I still don't know if I am.

Spock.

Spock.

This is Michael Burnham.

She will be staying with us.

You will be teaching her
the ways of Vulcan.

I expect you to be friends.

Hello.

Ops, please tell
me what is wrong.

Does she need our assistance?

Unable to comply, Captain.

Enterprise
is completely off-line.

Except for life support.

Scans show
203 crew members aboard.

The vessel's
entire complement is alive.

They're still sending
a priority one distress call,

but the signal's too compromised
for voice transmission.

Morse code might get through!

Sorry. Sorry.
It's just there was static.

You know, then Comms
kind of turned it down.

But... I mean, obviously.

Sorry.

Hey, go, Comms.

Um, can Enterpriseswitch

to Morse code?Excellent suggestion, Ensign.

Mr. Bryce, please try that.

A former colleague

is an ethnobotanist
on that ship.

I've seen its specs.

Only something catastrophic

could knock her out.Helm, do you detect

any escape pods or shuttles?Negative, sir.

Damn, she's a beauty.

Transmission coming through.
Captain Christopher Pike

requests permission
to come aboard.

He has an engineer
and science officer with him.

Permission granted.

Commander Burnham,

you will join me
in welcoming them.

Yes, sir.

I had not expected
to see Spock again.

Neither had I.

Attention, all.
Prepare for duty.

Please report
to your division duty officer.

Your brother is the science
officer on theEnterprise.

Foster brother.

I can sense your endocrine
system in overdrive.

: You are
anxious to see him.

I'm fine, Saru.Oh, I was using the term

in its most positive sense,
meaning "anticipatory."

We received a priority alert

from one of Starfleet's
most prominent ships.

I am on mission
and in problem-solving mode.

That's what you're sensing.

Hmm.

Order confirmed
Transport coordinates locked.

Do you have any siblings?

Oh, a sister.

Siranna.

Uh, I do not expect
a reunion with her.

Sadly, there is terrain
between us we cannot navigate.

I know the feeling.

Transporter locked status.
Energizing.

Welcome aboard,

Captain Pike.

I am Commander Saru,

acting captain
of the USS Discovery.

How may we be of service?

Well, Commander,
this is awkward,

but back in Mojave,
I learned the best way

to get into a cold stream
was to jump right in.

Uh... yeah.Ah.

I'm here at Starfleet's order
to take command of the Discovery

under Regulation 19,
Section "C."

Well, we received

no notice from Starfleet.

Because I asked
to deliver the news myself

out of a respect for what you

and your crew have been through.

Forgive me, Captain.

Your directive is
only instituted

under three contingencies:

when an imminent
threat is detected,

when the lives of Federation
citizens are in danger,

or when no other officers
of equal or higher rank

are present
to mitigate this threat.

May I ask under which
contingency you are here?

All of them.

I see where the Federation
puts its pennies.

Do not covet thy neighbor's
starship, Commander.

Besides, we've got
the new uniforms.

And lovely uniforms
they are, Captain.

Very colorful.

Over the past 24 hours,
Federation sensors picked up

seven red bursts spread out

across more than
30,000 light-years.

They appeared in
perfect synchronization

just long enough for
us to get a reading

and then, just as
suddenly, disappeared.

Except for one.

Such precise synchronization
all but rules out

the chaos
of natural phenomena.

Are they some kind of signal?

That's what we're calling
it, but I'll leave the rest

to my science officer.
Your ball, Connolly.

The signals don't seem
to be moons, stars

or any other type of planetoid.

Truth is, we can't detect
anything about them

or engage with them in any way.

Every time we tried to scan,

the computer went haywire.

Like a compass at
the North Pole.

Well put.

Why didn't we think
of that, Connolly? Huh?

Think of all the syllables
that gave their lives.

The metaphor seemed
a bit simplistic.

I believe it's a simile.

Then I owe you a
simile, Commander...?

Burnham. Michael Burnham.

He said you were smart.

We have someone in common.

Yes, I'm aware.

Mr. Spock.

I was expecting to see him.

Sometimes it's wise to keep
our expectations low, Commander.

That way
we're never disappointed.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.Excuse me.

Excuse me.Linus.

You okay? You look a little...

Yes.

I hear it's going around.

Perhaps the signals
are a temporal anomaly.

A tear in the fabric
of space-time.

Black holes can also cause
similar distortions.

Not to this degree.

Six hours ago the signal
stabilized long enough

for us to get a fix
on its position.

We were on our way to its
coordinates when suddenly, boom.

Enterprisesuffered multiple
catastrophic systems failures.

Starfleet is sending a team
to tow it to Spacedock

for a full diagnostic.

I'll kindly need
your command codes, Mr. Saru.

I cannot do that.

Pardon me?

"Starship command shall
not be transferred

"without DNA authentication

witnessed by the
entire bridge crew."

It is standard operating
procedure since the war.

O-Of course it is.
Yes, of course.

Bless you.

Okay, Captain Pike.

Stand by for verification.

Um, I'm-I'm Ensign Sylvia Tilly.

I'm-I'm Discovery's
newest addition

to Starfleet's
Command Training Program.Hi.

Yeah, you have really
beautiful nail beds.

Thank you.You're welcome.

Oh, I know what's wrong.
Uh, your pinkie is, um...

It's
just really weird

to say "pinkie"
to a captain.

It's not a very
authoritative finger,

but, um, you know,

it's not on the right pad.
Do- Can I...?

Kidding.
Oh, my God.

I thought I broke
a captain.

Sorry. I-I don't understand.

All the pertinent
information should be, uh...

There. Oh, God. I'm...

That's your file.
I'm sorry, sir. I...

That's all right, Ensign.

Everybody, grab a seat.
Go ahead.

I want you all
to give that a read.

I'm Captain Christopher Pike.

Up there are my commendations,

my diagnosis
of childhood asthma.

Ah, he big red "F,"

that was my failing grade in
astrophysics at the Academy.

I know this is a hard left turn.

You were en route to Vulcan
to pick up a new captain.

I was briefed on
the classified details

surrounding your last one.

I know he betrayed this crew.

If I were you, I'd have my
doubts about me as well.

But I'm not him.

I'm not Lorca.

The Federation's hackles are up.

I don't have to remind you that
the last time we investigated

a previously unknown
energy distortion,

it resulted in the Klingon war.

These mysterious signals

are unlike anything
we've encountered.

The energy needed
to create them

is beyond anything
we understand.

Is it a greeting?

A declaration of malice?

That's why they put me
on the Discovery

when the Enterprisewent down;

nobody wanted to wait
to find out.

But right now,
this little dot

is the only one willing
to tell us where it is.

Helm, plug in the coordinates.

Let's pay a visit.

Warp factor five.

Aye, sir.

With your permission,
Commander Saru.

The ship is yours, Captain.

All right, then.

Hit it.

Do you hear that?

I sent you my favorite aria
so that you would reconsider

your wildly lame position
on Kasseelian opera.

And to add insult to injury,
I got us actual tickets.

I know. I know you
say you hate it,

and that you only
do it for me, but...

I do love it when you
only do things for me.

I love it.

All right.
I'll see you later.

Commander?

Commander Stamets?

Oh, sorry to interrupt.

Um, given our new mission,

I've been assigned
as Command Program Trainee

to manage the reallocation
of the ship's resources.

The spore drive...I finally understand

why Hugh was so enamored
with Kasseelian opera.

Oh.

The tonal matrices
woven together...

the weird rapture between
instruments and voice...

Hugh said
it would reach me.

And he was right... as usual.

Um, so since the spore drive
is inactive, um,

the-the, uh, the engine room
is, um, being converted

back into a standard, uh,
engineering workspace

until Disco's up
and jumping again.

Um, I did notice
that they neglected

to assign you a new lab.

But then I remembered
Brianna in Logic Sciences

has two stories on the third
level, and then it hits me,

"Why does she need
all that space?"

Logic science is
basically meditation.

I mean, I've never
seen the woman move.

So I put her in a utility closet
on 12 and I put you in there.

I'm drunk on power.

Thanks, Tilly,
but it isn't necessary.

Well, what do you want me to do
with your equipment?

Just put it in storage.

No, really.

After the peace accord in Paris,

the Vulcan Science Academy
offered me

a permanent teaching position.

I said yes.

W-Wh- You're gonna stay
on Vulcan?

But what about the, uh,
network?

You have it by the tail.

You have so much more
to accomplish.

Did you know that
a Kasseelian prima donna

trains her whole life
for one performance?

And after she hits
that last high "E,"

she plunges a dagger
into her own chest and dies?

She's lived an entire
lifetime in that last note.

And I've lived
an entire lifetime

in what I've accomplished here,
on Discovery.

But what about...?Hugh is everywhere I look,
Tilly.

How much am I supposed to take?

Starfleet approved
my transfer.

It's been postponed until the
completion of Pike's mission.

Sir, I just have
to tell you that, um,

I understand that this place
may be haunted for you,

but maybe it's good haunted,

maybe living with ghosts
and energies that are bigger

than we are is why
you love science.

Tilly. You are...

...incandescent.

You're going to become
a magnificent captain

because you do
everything out of love.

But...

I need you to repeat after me.

Okay.

"I will say..."I will say...

"... fewer things."

...fewer thing- Okay.

I don't want you to go.

"'Would you tell me, please,

"which way I ought to go
from here?'

"'That depends a good deal on
where you want to get to,'

"said the Cat.

"'I don't care much where,'
said Alice.

"'Then it doesn't matter

which way you go,'
said the Cat."

Which way do you want to go?

Home. To Earth.

I'm gonna take you there
someday, sweetheart.

Door.

May I enter?

Yes, of course.

It would appear the human
proverb is accurate:

old habits die hard.

Or they never die at all.

I wasn't aware you knew
Amanda read Aliceto me.

While I was often occupied
by work in the evenings,

it did not prevent my listening
from upstairs.

Her voice gave comfort
to us both.

I will be leaving Discovery

as soon as we drop out of warp.

Vulcan High Command has asked
that I work with Starfleet

in assembling
a Federation task force.

These signals
must be deciphered,

and the timing must be
considered, so soon after a war.

Do you think they're related?

Could the Klingons be involved?

No.

I reached out to
High Chancellor L'Rell.

The Klingons have seen
the signals, too,

and they have no explanation
for them, either.

Why do you think
he didn't come on board?

Undoubtedly, Spock
has devoted himself

to brining the
Enterpriseback on line.

There's more to it than that.

How long has it been
since you spoke to him?

Years.

Me, too.

When I first came to you,

I-I know that you considered
every possible effect

a Vulcan education,
a Vulcan life,

might have on a human child.

What did you want Spock
to learn from me?

Empathy.

Something he would need
to understand

to successfully interact
with humans.

Wouldn't he have learned this
from our mother?

Spock has great reverence
for his mother.

But reverence tends to...

Fill up the room.

Indeed.

So from a peer,

a sibling, you thought...

Yes.

But I do not think
I was successful.

I do not think he ever
fully accepted you.

He may have.

For a time.

Just a time?

I'm discouraged he did not
embrace the lesson.

Father, I am confident that
empathy is very real for Spock.

I can hear the
missing notes, Michael.

There is something
about your relationship

you're not sharing.

It weighs on you.

Despite my departure,

I will avail myself to you,

should you choose to
speak of it someday.

Thank you.

In the meantime,
I suggest you focus

on the problem in front of you,
rather than what is behind.

We're approaching the signal's
coordinates, Captain.

Acknowledged.

Bridge crew,
give me a roll call.

Lord knows what's waiting
for us down there.

I want to know who
I'm facing it with. Sound off.

And skip your ranks,
they don't matter.

Clockwise from Science.

Michael Burnham.

Evan Connolly.

Gen Rhys.

Keyla Detmer.

Joann Owosekun.

Lieutenant Commander Airiam.

Ronald Altman Bryce.

Saru.

Just Saru.

All right.
Rhys, charge phaser cannons.

Bryce, start transmitting
standard Federation greeting.

Owosekun, Saru, Connolly,
Burnham, scan what you can.

Detmer... fly good.

Aye, Captain.

Yellow Alert.
Drop us out of warp.

I'm detecting something.

How close was that?700 meters.

I was expecting a red thing.
Where's my damn red thing?

All sensors are
at maximum power.

There's no sign
of the original signal

or any object that might
have generated it.

As if it were a mirage.

All right, let's ID
what nearly T-boned us.

See if it can provide
any answers.

It appears to be an
interstellar asteroid

traveling at 5,000
kilometers per second.

Sir, the point
of near impact

was the exact coordinates
of the signal.

Well, that's interesting.
Chase it, Detmer.

Chasing, sir.What do the scans tell us?

There's interference from
a hyper-dense cloud

of charged particles.

This rock has an atmosphere.

How? It isn't large enough
to generate

a sufficient gravity field.

Not so sure about that.

We just splashed into
a deep gravity well

that appears to be
rapidly fluctuating.

Okay. I want to know
what's down there.

Suggestion. Discoveryhas
telescopic cameras

to help aid in hull repairs.

We point them at the asteroid
and capture images.Love it. Do it.

Images are coming in,
but closer is better.

Increase to one-quarter impulse.Accelerating one-quarter, sir.

Report!
We just ed apart

like two similarly charged
magnets.

I've never experienced
anything like it.

Our interaction has changed
the object's trajectory.

It is now on a collision course
with a pulsar.

Time to incineration:
five hours.

There's a Starfleet vessel
down there.

On screen.

I picked up a strange chasm
cutting across

the ice field of
the asteroid's surface.

They crash-landed.

Hail them, Bryce.

Absolutely no response, Captain.

There's no way to zoom in
any further.

Commander Saru,

I know your vision has a larger
optical window than ours.

Can you make out
the registry number?

N-C-C dash 8-1-5.

A medical frigate.

Running it.

The USS Hiawatha,

thought destroyed
by the Klingons ten months ago.

Any life signs?

Still impossible
to scan, sir.

The asteroid's temperature is
negative 120 degrees Celsius.

Helm, stay on their tail.

Prep a landing party.

Is there any location on that
asteroid that we can beam to?

Negative. The cloud
of charged particles

will disrupt transporter
signals.

Without pattern enhancers,

transport to and from
the asteroid is too dangerous.

A shuttle?RHYS: The unpredictable
gravity fields

would make landing impossible,
sir.If there's anybody down there,

I'm not leaving them there
to die.

It is my duty to articulate
that the odds of survival

in a crashed ship on one of
the most hostile environments

in space are unlikely,

and risking more crew
to confirm that fact,

well, it requires consideration.

I'm considering
that if you're wrong,

we've got less than five hours
to get them out.

Landing on an asteroid traveling

at 5,000 kilometers per second

with spotty telemetry
and no transporter...

I know what it is, Commander.

I didn't sit out the war with
my crew just to stand down now.

Listen, I don't mind dissenting
opinions, I really don't,

but they have
to come with solutions.

Yes. I have one.

That's what I was trying
to offer.

And for the record,

there is not a single person
on this bridge who would abandon

a Starfleet brother
or sister... sir.

Right there with you.

What did you have in mind?

We have less than two hours
to fly down

to the asteroid's surface
and search for survivors,

then set up pattern enhancers
and beam back.

Unless our signals get caught up
in all that E.M. distortion

and we rematerialize
in a billion pieces.

You want out, Connolly?
Now's the time.

Not a chance, sir.
I love roller coasters.

What about you, Burnham?I'm not uncomfortable with risk.

Get your red shirt into a EV
suit, Nhan. You're with us.

Can't wait, sir.

Hey, I need a sample
of that asteroid.

I was down in engineering
during the flyby, right?

I noticed that all the spores
started going crazy

the closer we got.

It-it may be a coincidence,

but I haven't seen a
mycelial energy spike

like this since the Tardigrade.

Stamets must be
having a field day.

Um... Stamets is transferring
off the ship.

And if you ask me
any more questions,

I'm gonna start crying like
a baby Tribble in the k*ll zone.

Promise you'll be coming back,

'cause I can't lose
two people in one day.

That's right. You can't
promise that. Um, lie to me?

I'm coming back, Tilly.

All non-essential personnel,

please clear
main shuttle bay immediately.

Landing pod one,

stand by for launch prep.

Landing pod four,
stand by for launch prep.

Landing pod two,
five minute check complete.

Landing pod pilots,
you are clear to board.

Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

Launch stations
one through four engaged.




(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).({});

Pod Control, stand by

Auto navigation system on line.

These lander pods were developed
for a mission to Kim-Tara.

It has similar
gravimetric conditions.

You've flown 'em before,
Burnham?BURNHAM: Yes, sir.

I was one of the test pilots.
Nine Gs for 11 minutes.

Maintaining for 11 minutes seems
like a bit of a stretch.

For some of us, maybe.

Okay, guys.

launch sequence confirm.

Thrusters ready on my mark.

Launch in five...

four... three... two...

one.

Auto navigation confirmed.

I don't like those thermals.

The rock's under
so much pressure

that when the gravity
field fluctuates,

the debris inflates.You mean explodes?

Really? Are you surprised?

I'm not detecting any pattern to
these energy field detonations.

Magnetics are messing
with my nav computer.

I'm peaking, too.
Switch to manual navigation.

I'm losing control.

These pods are built
for this, Nhan.

Just take the stick manually.

You mean manuallymanually?

Connolly,
your field is too wide.

Watch the boulders
in lateral grid six.

Ooh!

Connolly, I'm telling you

your field is too wide!

Pull back, Lieutenant.
That's an order!

Sir, she didn't alter
the computer's flight patterns

to adjust for the gravitational
fluctuations. I've got this.

You can't rely on sensors!

Don't question my calculations.

My roommate at the academy
was part Caitian.

And she was a year ahead of me,
Burnham, but I told her

what I'll tell you-
just relax and let me do...

No!

Connolly?!

Pod three is down.

Pod two has sustained
structural damage.

Navigation is off-line.

Structural integrity
compromised.

System failure is imminent.

Initiating ejection sequence.

Warning:
Exo-suit initiation failure.

Auto eject override.

Discovery,
I have system-wide failure.

Negative on evac.
I am in total free fall.

Captain Pike,

we are running a remote
diagnostic on your pod now.

It's dead. That's the diagnosis.

No. My thruster pack's damaged.
The damn helmet's stuck.

Discovery,can you activate the
captain's ejector seat remotely?

Lot of surface distortion.
I need another 30 seconds.

Without EV boosters,
he'll still be in free fall.

Not if I can catch him.

Forget it, Burnham. I already
lost one officer today.

I'm comfortable
with the risk, sir.

And I'm not. If you screw
this up, we're both dead.

Stay on mission.
That's an order.

2,000 feet till impact.

You need to trust us, sir.
I told you

we don't abandon each other.

Discoveryhas you.

We have him, right, ladies?

Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

Do it.

Calculating the burn rate

Once I eject, take control

Nhan, stay on course

You'll be fine.
I'm going after the captain.

Copy that.
Go get 'em, Burnham.

I have a lock.Plotting your

If this works, you have less

Burnham?

Burnham, do you copy?

Discovery,this is Burnham.
We have touchdown.

There's a ton of interference.

Tilly was right.

The asteroid's energy density
is off the charts.

We need to get her a sample
for analysis.

My God.

Red alert. Red...

Perimeter red alert.

Collision imminent.

Man, they came down hard.

Titanium. Snapped in half.

The gravitational field
was probably

ten times stronger
when they landed.

I have an incoming target.

It's made from scavenged
Starfleet tech.

I see navigation parts.

Looks like
multi-vector propulsions.

Inertial dampeners, too.
This design is...

Awesome. I know. I built them.

You're welcome.

Don't just stand there.
Follow the kids. Come on!

Are we breathable here?

Yup. Ditch your helmets,
and keep her coming.

Stop! Look down.

I don't have time
for you to get decapitated.

Oh, thank Christ
you guys are here.

I'm Commander Jett Reno,
Engineering.

I'd shake your hand, but

I'm up to my elbow
in Tellarite brains.

Captain Christopher Pike
of the USS Discovery.

This is Commander Burnham
and Commander Nhan.

Yeah. I saw the
Federation insignia.

It's why I didn't
vaporize you.

Who were you expecting?

Are you kidding? Maybe
someone with a bat'leth?

Never need to see
another one of those

for the rest of my damn life.

Ugh. Grek's head wound keeps
opening up, poor guy.

Nice to meet ya.

Relax. Tellarite blood's rich
in hemerythrin.

The only place on Earth
you'll find anything

like it is marine
invertebrates.

Evolution's a fickle
bitch, am I right?

How long have you...?Ten months, 11 days.

Remind me never to get stranded

in enemy space
with a war raging.

Commander Reno, the war's over.

No one's speaking Klingon,
so... we won?

There was an armistice.
We're at peace.

An armistice with the guys
who drink bloodwine?

Yes.

Hear that, Valentine?

The war's over.
We're going home.

Valentine took
a piece of shrapnel

to the left aortic valve.

Needed a transplant, but didn't
have a donor, so I piggybacked

his heart to a dead Bolian
to keep it ticking.

You're an engineer,
not a surgeon.

Body's just a machine,
and I read.

Commander, you kept all of these
officers alive by yourself?

The kids helped. I built them
to handle a lot of weight.

When I suspended
the counterweights,

they hung me upside down
like a bat.

When were you shot down?

On the way to Starbase 36.

We got most of the war-wounded
into escape pods,

but this batch was too critical
to move.

And you stayed behind?Of course I stayed behind. What
the hell would you have done?

Admittedly,
not the brightest move.

We've been rocking
and rolling for hours.

Can someone tell me
what's going on?

This asteroid is

on a collision course
with a pulsar.

The gravitational field is
gonna tear this place apart.

Uh. What a relief.
Thought we were all gonna die.

Can you get us
the hell out of here, or what?

We're damn sure gonna try.

The pads are still intact.

Can we move your patients?Dicey, but yeah.

Ready.

Set up the enhancers
around the ship-

widest perimeter possible-
then meet us at sickbay.

Got it.

We're in business.

Why are we moving them if you're
creating an enhancement field

big enough to beam
from anywhere on the ship?

The enhancers are
just a backup in case

the Hiawatha'smain transporter
doesn't stay on line.

Ship-to-ship beaming on the pads
is far more reliable, and it'll

be safer for your patients.
See if you can get that one up.

Where the hell were you
ten months ago?

Commander, do you know anything
about the signal?

What signal?

Well, we found you by tracking
the coordinates of a signal,

one of seven.

Turned up
straight out of nowhere.

I don't know anything about it.

Once the perimeter's set,

we can start beaming them out
six at a time.

Enhancement field is on line!

Let's go! Let's go!

We have transporter signal, sir.

Proximity alert, sir.

The debris is getting worse.

If the transporters are up,
then we have no shields.

Yellow alert! Evasive maneuvers!

Starboard impact!

That asteroid will not hold
together much longer.

Comms, notify Dr. Pollard
and have her team ready

to receive survivors
in the transporter room.

Come on, come on, come on.

Yes.

The first wave of patients
are aboard, Captain.

Keep us in transporter range.

Pike to Discovery.Standing
by for final transport.

Rerouting power.

Burnham, let's go.

Burnha-

Discovery,if you can hear me,

track my signal.

Helmet!

Are you all right?Yeah.

Pike to Discovery.
Get us out of here.

Wait!

Oh. Excuse me.

Excuse me. S-Sorry.

Are you okay?

Femoral shaft fracture.
Dr. Pollard said I'd be up

on my feet in two hours.

It's okay if you forgot
the sample. I-

The only thing I care
about coming back is you.

Tilly, I-I had it, in my hand.

But when I beamed out, the
transporter didn't get a lock.

Then that would mean
that the asteroid

is not entirely comprised
of baryonic matter.Right.

Could mean that Discoveryis...
touching something

impossible. Yeah.Impossible.

A-a bridge to a
potentially unlimited

and-and 100%-efficient
energy source.

A new branch of science
could be sprouting before us,

and we are its founding mothers.

It would explain the volatile
gravitational energy.

I-I need to...Get that sample

before it's swallowed up by
that pulsar. Now, the asteroid

has been shedding rocks
all over the place.

I mapped several
of their trajectories.

We still have time
to reach one of them.

This is what you've been doing
since you were rescued?

You're supposed
to be recovering.

I'm a terrible patient.

I second that.

67 minutes until
vaporization.

Go.

Tilly to Engineering.

Get me a gravity simulator

and meet me
in the shuttle bay now.

The bridge is standing by
and ready to receive.

Is there a flux coupler
in the crate?

We need it to activate
the power relays.

Something like this?

What are you
doing here?Well, that depends.

Are you attempting to capture
an asteroid, Ensign Tilly?

Uh, just a little piece.
If my theory's correct,

we'll be able to interact
with dark matter, sir.

Well, I'm offended I
wasn't invited to the party.

Oh, my- oh my, God,
you're so invited.

Everybody clear!

Gravity simulator
is on line, Captain.

Copy that, Ensign.
We'll get into position.

Mr. Saru.

My mission has ended.

I believe this one's yours.

Thank you, Captain.

Lieutenant Detmer,
engage your intercept course

and place the asteroid
directly in our wake.

It'd be my pleasure, sir.

This feels bad.

Hold tight.Aft shields at 110% of maximum.

90 seconds
until they overload.

Detmer, pump the brakes.

It's in the bay.

All systems intact.

Good to go, Commander.

Helm, get us out of here.

Shuttle bay, what's your status?

I thought it'd be bigger.Mm.

The shuttle bay needs a little
TLC, but all is well, Commander.

This is the power
of math, people!

Come on!You are correct, Ensign.

Come in.

Ah.

All better? Can't have
my science officer

walking around looking
like that tower in Pisa.

Dr. Pollard is the definition
of "meticulous."

Mm.

I heard you were staying on
with us.

Oh. Yeah.

The damage to Enterprise
was severe.

Engineering Corps has no idea
when she'll be back on line.

Does Commander Saru know?

Yes.

And we'll treat this like a...

joint custody situation.

He's got a lot
of smart.

And since the Federation
has entrusted Discovery

with determining the source
and intent of those signals,

I need all the smart I can get.

And I need a new
ready room.

: Where the hell
do people sit, huh?

They don't.

Lorca wasn't one
to encourage discourse.

Well,

I want my officers
to feel like they can

pull up a chair
and speak freely.

Why don't we get the hell out
of here, huh?

Come on.

Yes, sir.

Has Spock told you why he and
I don't have a relationship?

No.

Not specifically.

I'm the reason.

I'd like to go
to Enterprise,sir.

To see him.

I'm sorry, Burnham,
but Spock's not there.

He took leave.

Missing the war...

while the Enterprise
was on its five-year mission,

that, uh...

took a toll on my crew,

a toll on Spock.

On me, too.

Even if they had
called you back,

you were so far away, you
wouldn't have made it in time.

Starfleet ordered you
to stay away for a reason.

Enterprisewas an instrument
of last resort.

"What is the logic
in staying away

if there is nothing left
to come back to?"

Spock asked the most
amazing questions.

It's completely logical

yet somehow able to make
everyone see that logic

was the beginning of the
picture and not the end.

He was ahead of all
of us, in that way.

A few months ago,

I... I felt something
shift in him.

It was as if he'd run into
a question he couldn't answer.

He-he didn't want
to share it with me.

With anybody.

And you have no idea
what it might have been?

No. Spock's one
of my bridge officers.

I trust him implicitly.

He asked me for time,
and I gave it to him.

How long will he be gone?

Not sure.

He had months and months
accumulated.

I'd still like to go aboard.

I don't know
what I expect to find,

but...

I need to.

Captain Pike to the bridge.

You should go.

And, Burnham...

...wherever our mission
takes us,

we'll try to have a little fun
along the way, too, huh?

Make a little noise.

Ruffle a few feathers.

I look forward to it, Captain.

Personal log.

As a child, I had what my mother
called nightmares.

She taught me to control my fear
by drawing it,

rendering fear powerless.

The nightmares have returned.

The same vision,
again and again.

I now understand its meaning

and where it must lead me.

In the event of my death,

I have encoded it
within this audio file.

This may be my last entry
aboard the Enterprise.

There are so many
things I wish I'd said to you,

so many things
I want to say now.

I'm too late, aren't I?

Oh, Spock.

I can only pray
I don't lose you again.

Brother.
