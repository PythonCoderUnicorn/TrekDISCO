"on Star Trek: Discovery..."
"So we're going"
"to the Ninth Circle of Hell"
"to capture a Red Angel."
"Michael, the Red"
"Angel, it's you."
"Your parents were k*lled"
"because of me."
"My father was"
"a xenoanthropologist,"
"my mother was an astrophysicist."
"They wouldn't have been involved"
"in Section 31."
"I was careless. I should have"
"done more to protect your..."
"Every moment you work"
"for Section 31,"
"you're announcing who you are."
"I don't always agree"
"with their tactics,"
"but I do believe"
"in their mission."
"The A.I. that infected Control,"
"we have to assume"
"that it could reemerge"
"at any time."
"Captain, if we're going"
"to capture the Red Angel,"
"I have to be the bait."
"Shutting down life support."
Now!
Mom?
"X-ray analysis"
"and GRB emission confirm"
"the supernova's imminent."
"Now harnessing the energy for"
"time crystal test nine beta."
"Charge is at 70% and rising."
"With any luck, we should be able"
"to make our first jump"
"very soon."
"Mom, dinner!"
"Did you know a star"
"goes supernova"
"every second in the universe?"
"And it releases more energy"
"in a few seconds"
"than our sun will"
"in ten billion years?"
"I didn't."
"Will Alpha Lupi"
"go supernova soon?"
"Three days feels like forever."
"The universe has its"
"own way of telling time,"
"baby girl."
"You were almost late for dinner."
"Oh, we'll forgive her."
"Very generous."
"Is the crystal stable?"
"How'd your calculations"
"turn out?"
"I'll have more than enough"
"energy for initial trials."
"Then we should celebrate. Yes, we should."
"Michael's so fascinated"
"by the supernova."
"Peas in a pod."
"I'm done for, by"
"the time she's 12."
"You and me both."
"Come to the table, baby."
"Uh, Mom?"
"There's a new light in the sky."
"It's probably just"
"a meteor, honey."
"But it looks like it's landing."
"Go, go, go!"
"Hide Michael, and"
"secure the lab!"
"I'll buy us some time! Go!"
Dad!
"I need you to be brave."
"Stay in here,"
"don't make a sound."
"It's gonna be okay."
Mommy?
"I love you, baby girl."
"Hey, hey. You're okay."
"You're safe."
"Welcome back, Commander."
"You were dead from toxic"
"asphyxiation for over a minute,"
"and you received a high dose"
"of tachyon radiation."
"That'll give anyone a headache."
"How long was I out?"
"Five hours."
"The Red Angel."
"I thought I saw my..."
"It was me, though, right?"
"The bio-neural signature..."
"There are, um,"
significant
"biological similarities"
"between, uh,"
"mothers and daughters."
Particularly
"the mitochondrial DNA."
What?
"That was real?"
"Yes, Michael."
"It's your mother."
No.
"No, she died."
"She died."
"She-she died."
"I heard..."
"And Leland, he..."
She...
"Where? I mean, where-where is..."
"She's being cared for"
"down on Essof IV."
"Easy, easy."
"It's not safe for you"
"to beam down."
"Not until the effects of"
"radiation poisoning dissipate."
"I... I can't sit here."
"Your mom's unconscious"
"but safe within"
"the containment field."
"Okay. How is this possible?"
"You must have"
"a million questions. How could she survive?"
"Is my dad alive, too?"
"I'm asking you"
"to be patient, Michael."
"My mom has been dead"
"since I was ten,"
"you're telling me"
"she's actually alive."
"How can you expect me"
"to be patient?"
"You woke..."
"sooner than expected."
"What did you find?"
"And I see"
"you are yourself again."
"Commander Stamets finished"
scanning
"the Angel's exoskeleton."
"It contains a data module"
"with hundreds of mission logs,"
"which Ensign Tilly"
"was able to download."
"I believe these will be"
"of interest."
"How many entries?"
841.
"You're the one to assess."
"See if you can find any answers"
"while we wait"
"for your mother to wake up."
"The room is sealed."
"No one will hear you."
"You're Control."
"I am, in holographic form,"
indistinguishable
"from any biological entity"
"I might choose to represent."
"And how long do you think"
"that will last?"
"They figured out"
"Admiral Patar wasn't real."
"There are 7,000 active ships"
"in Starfleet,"
"all reliant"
"on the chain of command."
"That chain is"
"unquestioned, unbroken,"
unseen.
"Every instruction,"
"passed down through channels."
"In time,"
"even those who would not"
"follow my agenda"
"knowingly... will."
"What am I doing here?"
"When I eliminated Admiral Patar,"
"it was easier"
"to simulate a Vulcan."
"Airiam's augmentation"
"allowed me a similar facade."
"But flesh is a different matter."
"There is an element of human"
"nuance I have not yet mastered."
"I require a face and a body"
"that will allow me"
"more freedom to operate."
"Your face. Your self."
Never.
"I am my own man."
"A man who has demonstrated"
"with his every action"
"a willingness to operate"
"from several different truths"
simultaneously.
"It has allowed you to make"
"questionable moral decisions"
"while avoiding the destructive"
"power of human guilt."
"You believe in the ends"
"more than the means."
"That pattern of behavior"
"is useful to me."
"Struggle... is pointless."
"You won't win."
"You joined Section 31"
"to keep a brutish universe"
"on its knees, Captain."
"To maintain order"
"by any means necessary."
"Your evolution... our evolution..."
"Is not a desecration"
"of that oath"
"but its very fulfillment."
Mommy.
"We'll be okay,"
"I know what to do."
"I can get us out of here"
"before they even arrive."
"I'm jumping back just an hour."
"Three, two, one!"
"950 years?"
"Where the hell am I?"
"Mission log 009."
"Mike, Michael, I keep trying"
"to get back to you,"
"but I can never manage to stay."
"Mission log 027..."
"Mission log 039..."
"Mission log 042."
"No matter how many times"
"I go back in time,"
"I can't stay anywhere"
permanently.
"The anchor keeps pulling me"
"back, 950 years away from you."
"There are no signs"
"of life anywhere."
"Antimatter detonation"
"across the galaxy"
"indicates Control"
"wiped everything out."
"Vulcan, Andoria, Tellar Prime,"
"Deneva, Earth."
"This is Earth."
"As far as I scan, everywhere."
"I'm alone."
"Captain, I'm registering"
"gravimetric instability"
"in the planetoid."
"Normal or abnormal occurrence?"
"Uh, definitely abnormal."
"It is centered directly"
"on our research facility."
"Mr. Saru, can you pinpoint"
"a possible cause?"
"I believe, Captain,"
"this is a classic example"
"of Newton's third law of motion."
"How every action has"
"an equal and opposite reaction."
"Sorry, it's just my"
"second favorite law"
"of physics."
"Uh, my first is, uh..."
"We know that"
"both Dr. Burnham"
"and her suit are tethered"
"to a point in the future."
"Our containment field"
"is holding her in the present."
"The tighter we hold,"
"the stronger time pulls back."
"In other words, we're playing"
"tug-of-war with the universe."
"Eventually, we will lose."
"We have a gravitational problem"
"on Essof IV."
"I need power..."
"Already on it, Commander."
"Divert all nonessential ship's"
"power to the surface."
"Give Commander Stamets"
"whatever he needs."
"Yes, Captain. - How long before"
"the universe wins?"
"Perhaps... an hour."
"Two at the most."
"Commander, get down there"
"and see what you can do."
"Lieutenant Bryce,"
"tell Dr. Culber"
"we're running out of time,"
"we need to wake up our patient."
"Aye, Captain."
"I need to talk to her"
"before we lose the chance."
"Our mission parameters"
"have changed."
"We set the trap assuming"
"Michael Burnham"
"was the Red Angel."
"That turn of events"
"has altered our agenda."
How?
"I saw Dr. Gabrielle Burnham's"
corpse
"on Doctari Alpha"
"with my own eyes."
"What, you're saying this woman"
"isn't Gabrielle Burnham?"
"I'm saying the woman"
"I saw is dead."
"We have no credible way"
"of knowing"
"who or what or what that woman"
"down there really is."
"A clone, some sort of unknown"
"genetic replica..."
"Maybe you simply don't like"
"the fact that Admiral Cornwell"
"placed her entirely"
"under Discovery's purview."
"I don't need to remind you"
"that, if Control downloads"
"the Sphere data embedded"
"in that ship's computer,"
"it will achieve consciousness,"
"and that is how this all starts."
"What if she was sent"
"to take the data"
"back to Control?"
"Or she came here to stop"
"Control from ever getting it."
"I know you both have feelings"
"for Michael Burnham."
"But we cannot afford to confuse"
"what you believe"
"her motivations are"
"with whomever that is"
"lying there."
"If she is a Trojan horse..."
"Discovery's defenses would"
"prove woefully inadequate."
"I have faith"
"in Discovery's crew."
"Faith is not a strategy."
"I understand this seems"
"like betrayal,"
"but we are the ones who need"
"to be holding that data."
"I have created a secure area"
"within our data storage."
"The Control module will never"
"be able to access it."
"Get me that data, Tyler."
"If Captain Pike"
"won't protect it..."
"then we must."
"You want me to commit espionage"
"against another Starfleet ship?"
"That is the job we have chosen."
"If your connection to Michael"
"is giving you pause,"
"I'll remind you that she is"
"being protected, too."
"She is more vulnerable"
"than anyone."
"Would you rather see"
"all sentient life"
"in the galaxy destroyed"
"because we failed to act?"
"You're quite resolute today."
"The times call for it."
"I built myself a home base"
"on a class M planet"
"50,000 light-years away."
"Wherever I jump,"
"the suit will always return me."
"Right back here."
"No preexisting technology,"
"so Control can't find me here."
"I'm safe for now."
"But Einstein couldn't"
"have been more right."
"Time's motion depends"
"on the observer."
"On the action."
"The people I was able"
"to move from Earth"
"to Terralysium,"
"as they call my planet,"
"are thriving."
"Their survival means"
"that time is fluid."
"The future can be changed."
"Maybe the past as well."
"I have to believe"
"I'll see you again,"
"my sweet daughter."
"Mission log 799."
"No matter what I do,"
"I can't stop Control"
"from getting the Sphere data."
"I've even tried"
"destroying the Sphere."
"But it's impossible."
"I taught my child"
"never to despair."
"But if I can't change"
"this one thing..."
"The only thing"
"I can think of now..."
"is to..."
"undo its gravitational binding."
"And put the Sphere"
"in Discovery's path."
"In the hopes"
"that they'll find a way"
"to keep the data safe."
"The Sphere data came to us"
"because of you."
"Come in."
"I trust the mission logs"
"have proven valuable."
"And perhaps difficult."
"Did you need something?"
"Dr. Culber's about"
"to report from the surface."
"I believe your mother"
"is regaining consciousness."
"Commander Stamets"
"reporting gravimetrics..."
"To be continued, Ensign."
"Mr. Bryce."
"Put Dr. Culber"
"on-screen, please."
"Aye, Captain."
"Did you manage to wake her up?"
"Yes. Dr. Burnham has regained"
consciousness.
"Tachyon radiation levels"
"are beginning to normalize."
"She's asking"
"to speak to you, sir."
"We'll be right down."
"I'm sorry, Commander."
"Dr. Burnham is asking"
"to speak with the captain."
"And only the captain."
"She's my mother."
"I'm sorry,"
"I'm just the messenger."
"There are so many questions"
"that need to be answered"
"right now."
"Whatever her reasons are"
"for not wanting to see me,"
"I should be the one asking."
"I understand your position."
"But I think we need to follow"
"Dr. Burnham's lead here."
"I must agree with the captain."
"I'm not asserting"
"my rights as a daughter."
"That would be childish."
"I am the one who knows her best."
"But there may be other"
"variables to consider."
"I mean, she's"
"experienced something"
"that no one else"
"in history ever has."
Look.
"I've been reinstated"
"for all of five minutes,"
"and I did it because I"
"wanted to help, but..."
"you have to consider"
"the fact that the person"
"your mother was before she"
"stepped into that time suit..."
"may not be who she is now."
"Who better to"
"gauge that than me?"
"I understand"
"your desire to see her,"
"but for now we do this her way."
"We need to establish trust if"
"we're going to get any answers."
Please.
"You're staying"
"on board, Commander."
"I'm sorry."
"You'll have to watch"
"from the feed."
"Sir, you won't be able to enter"
"the containment field,"
"but you can"
"go right up to it."
"It's taking more"
"and more energy to hold"
"Dr. Burnham"
"and the suit in place."
"Sooner or later,"
"probably sooner,"
"our reserves will run out."
"And she'll be pulled"
"into the future again."
"Then I'd better talk fast."
"Dr. Burnham."
"I'm Captain..."
"Captain Christopher Pike."
"USS Enterprise."
"In temporary command"
"of Discovery."
"But soon you'll return"
"to your ship."
"I could say more"
"about your future,"
"but you won't like it."
"Well, we're,"
"uh, not here to talk about me."
"Then let's talk about the fact"
"that I came here"
"to save my daughter,"
"and you deceived me."
"Michael risked her life"
"to bring you here."
"We understand the threat"
"to sentient life."
"You understand nothing."
"As long as there's"
"any possibility"
"of Control gaining access"
"to the Sphere data,"
"everything will die."
Always.
"I put that Sphere"
"in Discovery's path"
"so you could protect the data,"
"but even that didn't work."
"You have to let me keep trying."
"Then let us help you"
"finish the mission."
"Tell us what the signals mean."
"I don't know about any signals."
"- In the sky?"
"- Uh, seven simultaneously,"
"and then each one led us..."
"I said I know nothing"
"about them."
"You want to help?"
"Delete the Sphere archive."
"Without that data, the"
"A.I. cannot evolve."
"We're protecting it."
"Don't you understand?"
"Time is a living thing."
"It has gravity and will"
"and it's pulling"
"the A.I. closer."
"I've seen it with my own eyes."
"And you believe"
"that deleting the archive..."
"will stop the A.I."
"from evolving?"
Yes.
"But if you miss something,"
"I'll have no choice"
"but to try again"
"and again and again."
"You have to release me."
"I can't do that."
"I'm sorry, Doctor."
"You're a ghost to me,"
"Captain Pike,"
"one of hundreds"
"of trillions that fill"
"a galactic graveyard."
So...
"until you're willing"
"to do what I say,"
"exactly as I say,"
"this conversation is over."
"Deleting the Sphere archive"
"is tantamount to burning"
"the Library of Alexandria."
"Or the Bibliotheca Corviniana."
"This knowledge is invaluable."
"Protecting it, safeguarding it,"
"is a central tenant"
"of the Federation"
"and our sworn duty"
"as Starfleet officers."
"Unless that knowledge poses"
"a clear and present danger"
"to all sentient life."
"From a security perspective,"
"I have to ask,"
"what if Dr. Burnham,"
"your mother, has an agenda"
"we're not aware of?"
"The one thing that I witnessed"
"about my mother, over and over,"
"was her relentless"
"pursuit of facts."
"So if she believes"
"that deleting the archive"
"will defeat the A.I., I have"
"no doubt that she's right."
"I agree with Burnham."
"Deleting the archive"
"is our best option."
"I will proceed."
"What's happening?"
"I do not know, Captain,"
"the system is not responding"
"as it should."
"The data memory core is"
"partitioning itself."
"Reconfiguring its"
"security directives"
"into a new language matrix."
"How can it do that?"
"The intelligence is a remnant"
"of the Sphere itself."
"When we first"
"encountered the Sphere,"
"its data was"
"determined to survive."
"And it still is."
"The archive is"
"building firewalls"
"around itself"
"using xeno-encryption"
"taken from its own"
"historical language database."
"Can you work around it?"
"He wouldn't be able to."
"He needs a linguistic key."
"The encryption is based on a"
"language from a civilization"
"that hasn't existed"
"for a thousand centuries."
"It seems, Captain,"
"the archive will not allow"
"itself to be destroyed."
"Keep trying, Mr. Saru."
"We cannot allow"
"that data to survive."
"Mission log 271."
"Spock can understand me."
"I jumped back into his childhood"
"and warned him about Michael"
"dying in the forest."
"I haven't been able"
"to communicate with anyone else."
"Spock's Vulcan logic training"
"in human emotions"
"seem to give him"
"the psychological balance"
"to comprehend my existence."
"And his dyslexia"
"allows him to process"
"the effects"
"of atemporal dysplasia."
"In all of time..."
"Spock may be the only person"
"who can help me."
"L'tak terai."
Dyslexia.
"I spent my entire childhood"
"attempting to conceal"
"my human failings"
"from those around me."
"It was never a failing."
"It was precisely what allows you"
"to process those visions"
"of the future."
"You helped Discovery chart"
"a new course."
"One that brought"
"my mother back to me."
"One that may very well"
"enable us to save the future."
"I was wrong to judge you..."
"as unfit to process"
"your own emotions."
"It was..."
Petty.
Unmerited.
"I can only imagine"
"what you must be feeling."
"I need to see my mother, Spock."
"You have questions,"
"beyond the scope of our"
"mission, that deserve answers."
"Let us speak to the captain."
Together.
"The Red Angel is awake."
"It's only a matter of time"
"before she... it, whatever"
"it is... tries to take that data."
"You are the only one"
"standing between survival"
"and obliteration."
"Is that in any way vague?"
"When they tried to delete"
"the Sphere data,"
"it protected itself."
"This is more complicated"
"than I thought."
"I find that hard to believe."
"Find it however you want."
"I'm not going to do this."
"It doesn't feel right to me."
"Is that in any way vague?"
"No. You made the right call."
"Stay on that ship"
"and keep me in the loop."
"Good work, Mr. Tyler."
"Because of how little time"
"we have, I'm obligated"
"to let you try this."
"Either she knows more about the"
"signals than she understands,"
"or her lack of knowledge"
"suggests they may have been"
"created by the"
"A.I. itself,"
"maybe to mislead or confuse us."
"Or there is a third variable"
"we have yet to realize."
"Which makes this conversation"
"all the more pressing."
"Time is out of joint.

O cursed spite, that I was
born to set it right."
Hamlet.
"Hell yeah."
Energize.
No.
No.
"This is like a dream."
"Did you delete the archive?"
"Did you destroy it?"
"We couldn't."
"But we're finding a solution."
"I knew it."
"This is why I told"
"him to let me go."
"Hey, hey."
Please.
"It's been 20 years."
"Talk to me."
"Is Dad...?"
Stop.
"People think time is fragile."
"Precious. Beautiful."
"Sand in an hourglass, all that."
"But it's not."
"Time is savage."
"It always wins."
"So this... is meaningless."
"No, this matters."
"You and me, here."
"Now matters."
"I know you're asking yourself"
"how, after,"
"after all these years"
"of wishing for a mother,"
"you could, you could"
"give her up,"
"now that she's"
"finally reappeared?"
"How could I?"
Easy.
"Neither of us has a choice."
"So you want to have"
"this conversation one day,"
"the right way?"
"Get me out of here."
"I need to try again"
"to alter the timeline."
"You reached out to Dad and me"
"through space and time."
"You never gave up on us."
"Why are you giving up on me now?"
"Haven't you learned anything"
"from those failures?"
"My God!"
"The stubbornness!"
"Where do you think"
"I got it from, Mom?"
"It's what kept you going"
"when you thought"
"you were all alone"
"in the universe."
"You were going to get back"
"to your family."
"To me."
"I am standing right here."
"Right now."
"I don't know what"
"you've been telling yourself"
"all these years, but I let you"
"go a long time ago."
"I had to."
"I've seen you die"
"a hundred times."
"And I'll see you die"
"a hundred more."
"That is my life and my prison."
"I can't hope anymore."
"I don't believe you."
"( =  || []).({});"
"There's only"
"the bigger picture now."
"Nothing else."
"How much longer until"
"the containment field fails?"
"43 minutes. We've increased"
"power to the field,"
"but the gravitational pull"
"on Dr. Burnham and the suit"
"is also increasing."
"We could give you guys"
"more power."
"Would that make a difference?"
"I'm channeling my inner Isaac"
"Newton, and I'm sorry to say,"
"it wouldn't, equal and opposite"
"reactions being what they are."
"Dr. Burnham has been focused"
"on trying to destroy the Sphere."
"Perhaps there is a reason"
"she has thus far failed."
"You think we're going about this"
"the wrong way?"
"Fourth century Earth philosopher"
"Lao Tze said,"
"Water is the softest thing,
yet it can penetrate mountains."
"An illustrative truth."
"What appears immutable"
"is not: a mountain,"
"the Sphere, time."
"In this case,"
"I wonder if time itself"
"may provide the answer."
"Instead of fighting time, we go with it."
"Stop trying"
"to destroy the Sphere,"
"and merge it right"
"into the river of time itself."
"You mean send it"
"so far into the future"
"it can't do us any harm?"
"I collected sensor data"
"from Dr. Burnham"
"when she first arrived."
"The Red Angel suit has"
"almost limitless quantum"
"computational power."
"Literally infinite storage."
Meaning...
"you can transfer the Sphere"
"archive into the suit,"
"program a destination beyond"
"Dr. Burnham's anchor point"
"and let the wormhole"
"take it forever?"
"Perpetual infinity."
"Control will never get the"
"data in order to evolve."
"But my mother is connected to"
"the future, just like the suit."
"What happens to her?"
"To sever your mother"
"from her space-time requires"
"the energy equivalent of..."
"a supernova."
"But we do have another..."
"massive source of exotic energy."
"The dark matter particles."
"We may be able"
"to modify a transporter enhancer"
"with dark matter."
"Yes, to pierce"
"the timestream long enough"
"to lock on Dr. Burnham and"
"beam her into our space-time."
Permanently.
"I like science."
"They would send the suit"
"into the future"
"and allow Dr. Burnham to remain."
"We cannot allow that."
"Dr. Burnham."
"You're truly threatened by her."
"And why aren't you?"
"You've always held"
"a superior note"
"because you exist in"
"two different universes."
"This woman exists across time."
"She's seen how you've"
"lived, how you'll die."
"She... is the"
"definition of power"
"you once were. Get to the point."
"Shoot all of that data into the future"
"in hopes that nothing will find it"
"poses an unacceptable risk"
"to the larger mission."
"Mm. Interesting turn of phrase."
"A mission you should"
"understand in your bones."
"You want her gone."
"Yes, and so do you."
"There is nothing she"
"hasn't witnessed."
"There is nothing"
"she does not have,"
"including Burnham's devotion."
"She has supplanted"
"you, Commander,"
"and she will supplant you"
"in every incarnation."
"And Tyler?"
"He has limits."
"You do not."
"Let me guess."
"If I place this"
"near the Angel suit,"
"we can steal Discovery's"
"data transfer"
"without their knowledge."
"And once the download"
"is complete,"
"this amplifier"
"will self-destruct,"
"destroying the time suit"
"and Dr. Burnham."
"As a Terran..."
"you should be able"
"to see the logic."
"And if she is"
"who she claims to be..."
"Then you are still"
"only the second most powerful"
"woman in the universe."
"Is that who you want to be?"
"Contact me"
"once you've placed the device,"
"so I can begin the upload."
"What are you doing, Christopher?"
"Michael, what are they planning?"
"They're transferring"
"the Sphere data to your suit."
"Which they will then send"
"into the future."
"They think that's the way"
"to protect us all."
"Are you here to k*ll me,"
Philippa?
"Would I tell you"
"if that were the case?"
No.
"I just want to talk"
"to you privately"
"and see up close"
"the woman Michael has mourned"
"for 20 years."
"I've seen you sacrifice"
"yourself for her,"
"surrendering your own life"
"without a moment's hesitation."
"I thank you for that."
"You have obviously confused me"
"with my sentimental"
"prime-universe counterpart."
"I'm Terran."
"Self-sacrifice is not our way."
"I know exactly who you are"
"and what you're capable of."
"I doubt I would sacrifice"
"my life to save the galaxy."
"You'd be surprised"
"what you'd do for"
"the people you love."
"Quite the feat of engineering:"
simple,
elegant,
"yet incredibly powerful."
"The suit is DNA-strand encoded."
"It won't operate"
"for just anyone,"
"in case you were thinking"
"of taking it for a spin."
"I get my thrills in other ways."
"But time travel must be"
"an elixir of some kind."
"Intoxicating enough"
"to make one forget"
"about domestic matters."
"A child, perhaps?"
"Your mother"
"didn't teach you how to look"
"but not touch, I see."
"My mother taught me"
"many different things"
"in our universe."
"Above all,"
"she taught me to survive."
"We're at five percent."
"Six percent."
"Seven percent."
"Is that...?"
"Sphere data. Yes."
"Monitor it for me."
"We leave orbit the"
"moment it's complete."
"So we've met."
"Most people say I'm
pleased we've met."
"Most people are predictable."
"Philippa, I want your"
"word on something,"
"mother to mother."
"I rarely make promises."
"That's why I'm asking you."
"You love her."
"Promise me"
"you'll take care of her."
"Perhaps you'll find a way"
"to look after her yourself."
"Not as long as the A.I. exists."
"It considers me"
"an unacceptable risk"
"to the larger mission."
"It poses"
"an unacceptable risk"
"to the larger mission."
"I wondered why we lost our feed."
"Technology can be so unreliable."
"Have fun with..."
"whatever that is."
"When were you planning"
"to tell me you were"
"downloading the Sphere data"
"into my suit? It's a radical idea,"
"I know, but..."
"It's a brilliant plan."
"I'll be able to safeguard"
"the archive in perpetuity now."
"No, Mom."
"You won't have"
"to give up your life."
"We modified the transporters"
"to beam you permanently"
"into the present."
"We'll send the suit"
"into a future"
"where Control"
"can never reach you."
No.
"If your plan fails,"
"Control wins."
"There'll be no one there"
"to stop it."
"We can't take that risk."
"This will not fail."
"I need you to hear me:"
"I am not losing you again."
"Why are you contacting me"
"on a secure channel?"
"How much data has been"
"transferred to our ship?"
22%.
"This is about Leland, isn't it?"
"What I'm about to tell you"
"is the first real test"
"of our relationship, Mr. Tyler."
"Betray me,"
"and I'll live long enough"
"to hunt you down"
"and k*ll you slowly. Understood?"
"I've been k*lled"
"before, Georgiou."
"You're just telling me I'll have"
"time to enjoy the scenery."
"I've retrofitted these pattern"
"enhancers with dark matter."
"That should provide enough"
"energy to beam Dr. Burnham"
"out of her native"
"space-time into ours."
"But we only have"
"enough power for one attempt."
"So, theoretically,"
"this should work."
"It will work."
"Then we shut off"
"the containment field"
"and let the suit"
"take the data away forever."
"Time's not on our side, Michael."
"Mom, whether you like it or not,"
"I'm gonna save you from this."
"Mostly I'm gonna save you"
"from yourself."
"I remember the white dress"
"you wore the day you graduated."
"How could you know?"
"I watched you"
"when you first beamed"
"aboard the Shenzhou"
"with Sarek."
"When you finally learned"
"the Vulcan salute"
"from Spock as a child."
"When you were alone and crying"
"because all the other Vulcan"
"children had rejected you."
"I was there when you"
"read Alice in Wonderland"
"out loud to yourself"
"on your 11th birthday,"
"pretending to read"
"it to your father"
"and to me."
"I heard you, baby. I heard you."
"And when that creature"
"came for you on Vulcan,"
"I was there."
"I have been there through all"
"those moments and so many more."
"Seeing you gave me"
"strength and resolve."
"Seeing you reminded me"
"of what I was fighting to save."
"I have been fighting"
"for you, Michael."
"To get back here to you."
"But I can't come home now,"
honey.
"Not yet."
"Not until this thing"
"is gone forever."
"Oh, Mom..."
"You did it."
"The data transfer's stopped."
Good.
"Now go find out what Leland does"
"in the dark."
"Say please."
"You won't win."
"Leland said the same thing."
"Commander Stamets is ready, sir."
"Prepare to transport..."
Captain.
"Priority message"
"from the Section 31 ship."
On-screen.
Leland.
"It's too late."
"I can beam them now, Captain."
"They're Dr. Burnham's"
"only defense."
"Captain, we have a problem."
"It'll have to wait."
"Dr. Culber, Dr. Pollard,"
"stand by for incoming wounded."
"Sorry, Captain, this cannot wait."
"The Section 31 ship"
"is diverting our data transfer."
"How much Sphere data"
"have they downloaded?"
"37% thus far."
"Captain, gravity is"
"fluctuating wildly."
"The field can't"
"hold much longer."
"He's taking the Sphere data."
"Drop the containment field."
"I'll go back and stop him."
"We're not going to do that."
No!
"- Mom, stay down."
Michael!
"Come on, I got you, I got you."
"Come on, over... come here."
"Captain, we cannot stop"
"the data transfer."
"How much data"
"has he downloaded now?"
"45%. 46."
"The transfer speed"
"is increasing."
"Can we still pull my mom"
"into our timestream?"
"He destroyed the"
"control station."
"You need to destroy"
"the containment field."
"Without the suit,"
"he cannot take the data."
"If we do that,"
"you get yanked back."
"And then you don't have"
"a suit to navigate"
"the timestream."
"He'll k*ll her, Michael."
"At least this way"
"she would have a chance."
"The transfer's being controlled"
"by something"
"within the facility."
"Come up with another solution."
"We haven't come this far"
"to lose everything now."
"If we each shoot"
"one of the discs,"
"the power disruption"
"will release"
"the containment field."
"You have to let me go, Michael."
"It's the only way each of"
"us has a chance to survive."
"I'll find you, Mom."
"It'll be okay."
"I love you."
"I love you, too, baby girl."
Ready.
Now.
"Burnham to Discovery."
"Four to beam up."
"Then blow this place to hell."
"Landing party on board, Captain."
"- Fire torpedoes."
"Aye, sir. Firing torpedoes."
"Direct hit, sir."
"The Essof facility"
"has been destroyed."
Captain.
"I detected a transporter signal"
"from the surface"
"to the Section 31 ship."
"Damn it."
"Lock on a pursuit course."
"They've masked their"
"warp signature, sir."
"There's no way to pursue."
"Captain, I've picked up"
"a distress beacon"
"from an escape pod."
"One life sign."
"Identified as Ash Tyler."
"When the timestorm passes,"
"I'll come back for you,"
"baby girl."
"For you and your father."
"I promise."
"Leland received 54%"
"of the Sphere data."
Significant,
"but as the captain has stated,"
"we will continue the fight."
"She was right."
"What fight are we supposed"
"to be continuing, Spock?"
"Everything we try fails."
"Now, with no suit..."
"no time crystal..."
"it'll always be"
"one step ahead of us."
Respectfully,
"Dr. Burnham was incorrect."
"Now does matter."
"What happened before"
"no longer exists."
"What will happen next"
"has not yet been written."
"We have only now."
"That is our greatest advantage."
"What we do now"
"here in this moment"
"has the power to"
"determine the future."
"Instinct and logic together."
"That is how we will defeat"
"Control in the battle to come."
"We will find a way."
"All of history can change"
"with our next move."
"The board is yours, Michael."
