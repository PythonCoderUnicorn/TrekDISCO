BURNHAM:
"Any rational explanation"
"for the seven signals"
"continues to escape me."
"Tell us what the signals mean."
"I know nothing about them."
"You want to help,"
"delete the Sphere archive."
"As long as there's"
"any possibility"
"of Control gaining access"
"to the Sphere data,"
"everything will die."
"The archive will not"
"allow itself to be destroyed."
"Instead of fighting time,"
"we go with it."
"You can transfer"
"the Sphere archive into the suit"
"and let the wormhole"
"take it forever."
"Look, just come home."
"That version of me is dead."
"And I'm not going back."
"You're Control."
"You won't win."
"Struggle is pointless."
[screaming]
"Our mission parameters"
"have changed."
"He's taken the Sphere data!"
No!
"Captain, we cannot stop"
"the data transfer."
"The transfer speed"
"is increasing."
"We haven't come this far"
"to lose everything now."
"You have to let me go, Michael."
"If we do that,"
"you'll get yanked back."
"At least this way"
"she would have a chance."
BURNHAM:
"I'll find you, Mom."
"Now, with no suit,"
"no time crystal..."
"It'll always be one step"
"ahead of us."
SPOCK:
"Dr. Burnham was incorrect."
"What we do now has the power"
"to determine the future."
"The board is yours, Michael."
"DR. BURNHAM:"
"When the timestorm passes,"
"I'll come back for you,"
"baby girl."
"For you and your father."
"I promise."
COMPUTER:
"Incoming transmission"
"from Amanda Grayson."
"Michael, I heard"
"what happened."
"I am so sorry."
"How did you hear?"
Spock.
"All this time..."
"I thought she was dead."
"But it was so much worse."
"She was trying to stop Control."
"And I stopped her."
"I failed her."
"Then I lost her..."
"all over again.Michael,"
"you have it backwards."
"You found her."
"You will find her again."
"That is who you are.[door chimes]"
"Mother. I apologize"
"for the interruption,"
"but the captain needs us."
"Take care of"
"each other."
"I love you both."
"Thank you."
"Another signal has appeared."
"PIKE: This new signal is"
"the fourth of seven."
"It appeared over the Klingon"
"planet of Boreth."
"The time crystal in Dr."
"Burnham's suit was destroyed."
"There's no way she"
"could have come back"
"to create that signal."
"And she said she had"
"no knowledge of them."
"Which would suggest"
"these signals were created by"
"another time-travelling entity."
"Maybe a trap?"
"An agent of Control"
"from the future?"
"None of the events linked to"
"the signals would indicate that."
"That fact that one of them"
"led us to save"
"the people of Terralysium,"
"whose ancestors were saved"
"by Dr. Burnham herself,"
"makes me think that"
"these signals are..."
"BURNHAM: Speculating about"
"what the signals could mean"
"or who created them"
"is unproductive."
"What are you suggesting,"
Commander?
"I am asserting that"
"waiting around for these signals"
"to provide us answers"
"has proven to be"
"a colossal waste of time."
"To say nothing of the fact"
"that Leland is the A.I."
"He is Control."
"We should be joining"
"Agent Georgiou"
"in her search for him."
"SARU: We have"
determined
"that the Sphere archive"
"could not be"
"removed nor deleted"
"from this ship."
"By using Discovery"
"to pursue Captain Leland,"
"we would be placing"
"the data"
"directly within his reach."
PIKE:
"We all want to stop him."
"I understand why you want"
"to lead the charge,"
"but our priority is"
"safeguarding that data."
"So, we focus on"
"the mission at hand:"
"this new signal, and why"
"it appeared over Boreth."
"Mr. Tyler, any insight?"
"To the Klingons, Boreth is"
"revered for one reason."
"The monastery dedicated"
"to Kahless."
"It's the only non-native"
"structure on the whole planet."
"I don't know how"
"it relates to the signals,"
"but I can reach out"
"to Chancellor L'Rell"
"to arrange passage there."
"Excellent. Do it."

"I saw you back there."
"Whatever it is you're not"
"telling us about Boreth..."
"I need to know."
"Boreth is home to my son."
"Your son?"
Technically,
"Voq and L'Rell's son."
"L'Rell had hidden him away"
"for his own safety,"
"and I wanted to raise him... [child groans]"
"...to protect him."
"And instead, I risked"

Well,

"[chime sounds]"

Please.
L'RELL:
"The monastery is considered"
"the most sacred site"
"in the Klingon Empire."
"Their contact with outsiders"
"has been almost nonexistent"
"since our world was young."
"Control is a significant threat"
"to all of us, Chancellor."
"Something in that monastery"
"might even the odds."
"Is there any reason"
"you can think of"
"that the signal"
"would lead us there,"
"The monastery on Boreth"
"was not only built"
"to house the Followers"
"of Kahless,"
"but to protect a rare mineral"
"native to the planet,"
"guarded with Klingon lives"
"for generations."
"Time crystals."
"Dr. Burnham's suit was powered"
"by a modified time crystal."
"PIKE: A new time crystal could"
"let us send the Sphere data"
"into the future after all."
"The power to"
"manipulate time"
"is a weapon unlike any other,"
"and the very reason we"
"no longer exploit the crystals."
"But in this case,"
"our mutual survival"
"depends upon time manipulation"
"to defeat Control."
"Maybe the final three signals"
"will show us how to do that."
"Send me down to Boreth."
L'RELL:
No!
"We will not have"
"this conversation"
"in the presence"
"of Captain Pike."
Chancellor,
"circumstances are dire,"
"and time is critical now."
"I offer you my full discretion."
"For Agent Tyler to go to Boreth"
"would endanger a life."
L'Rell!
"The life of our son."
"His existence and yours"
"must be kept secret."
"I would never put"
"the Empire at risk."
"I have the right to see him."
"The dead have no rights."
"If it were discovered that our"
"child or you were still alive,"
"the Klingon Empire would"
"be vulnerable to sedition."
"I forbid you to go."
"I'll go. I agree"
"with Chancellor L'Rell. It isn't"
"safe for either of you to go."
"Nor would it be safe"
"for you, Captain."
"Boreth is not"
"for the faint of heart."
"Even as chancellor,"
"I hold no sway"
"over the monks"
"who guard the crystals."
"Noted. Can you help us establish"
"communications with them?"
"I can arrange an audience."
"But no Klingon,"
"let alone a human,"
"has ever taken a time crystal"
"from the monastery"
"without great sacrifice."
"The alternative is worse."
"Let us proceed."
"BURNHAM: According to Tyler,"
"every Section 31 ship"
"is required to check in"
"on an hourly basis."
"But this ship checked in"
"ten minutes past its hour."
"Because of the clandestine"
"nature of their mission,"
"they're not required to provide"
"any further information"
"on their status."
"You want to investigate"
"in person?"
"I'll take a shuttle."
"Discoverystays here."

"to go to the control room."
"You wanted me alone."
Why?
"I want your help,"
"Michael Burnham."
"You are the most"
"effective tool"
"to acquire the Sphere archive"
"from the Discovery."
"That is why I"
"lured you here."
"So that you, too,"
"can be reconstructed."
"SPOCK [over comm]: Michael,"
"do you copy? Gant is Control."
"You must reboot the system"
"to lock him out of the ship.[phaser powers up]"
"[metal groaning]"
[panting]
[grunts]
"Oh... [pants]"
"COMPUTER: Authenticating."
"Manual reboot commencing.[grunts]"
[grunts]
"[groans, pants]"
[grunts]
"[yelps, grunts]"
[grunts]
[groans]
"There's only one outcome.[groaning]"
[straining]
"Vulcan nerve pinch."
"[bones crunch][pained yell]"
"Would be effective if I"
"still had nerve endings."
"[Spock grunts]"
[panting]
[grunts]
"[yelps, grunts]"
"Spock!I am working on it."
[grunting]
"[Burnham screaming]"
[gasping]
[exhales]
"The floor is magnetized."
[panting]
"Once I realized"
"the nanobots contained"
"ferromagnetic materials,"
"I had to calculate"
"the correct electrical current"
"to run through"
"the metal in the ship's floor"
"to immobilize them."
"I apologize for being so slow."
"You were right on time."
"Control was blocking"
"my tricorder."
"Or we would have"
"known what he was."
"I've regained"
"control of the ship."
"Dropping us"
"out of warp."
"[engines power down]"
"Do you not wish to investigate"
"his programmed destination?"
"Control said I wasn't"
"here by accident."
"It only went along"
"with our plan..."
"to not raise suspicion"
"about its ultimate goal."
"Which was to turn me."
"Which indicates Control"
"has identified you"
"as the true threat"
"to its objectives."
"The one variable it"
"cannot account for."
"This was its attempt"
"to eliminate that variable."
"So maybe there's still"
"a chance to stop it."
"Maybe there is something"
"in the signals"
"that can help us finish"
"what my mom started."
"We must return"
"to the Discovery."
"PIKE: TheDiscovery"
"is now in possession"
"of a raw time crystal."
"How do you plan"
"to utilize it?"
"The three last signals have yet"
"to reveal themselves."
"I believe they'll bring"
"clarity to that topic."
"Stamets and Reno"
"are working to stabilize"
"the crystal's"
"volatile properties."
So...
"Tell me, Captain."
"What did the monks"
"ask in return?"
"What I experienced"
"is for me alone."
"That's a promise"
"that I made to your son."
"You saw him?"
"You talked to him?"
"I don't think I could"
"explain it if I tried."
"Oh, and he, uh..."
"...he asked me"
"to return this to you."
"The insignia of"
"the torchbearer."
"I had given it to him before"
"I sent him down to Boreth."
"Well, Tenavik said"
"that it, uh, helped him"
"a-along his own journey."
"He's where he needs to be"
"now and..."
"no longer needs it."
Tenavik?
"That is a good name."
"Thank you, Captain."
"But your, your son, uh..."
"...he was meant to be on Boreth."
"I-I was meant to..."
"be guided by him."
"So it seems that"
"we all had, uh..."
"and continue to have,"
"a part to play."
BURNHAM:
"Control isn't just contained"
"to Leland anymore."
"It has the ability"
"to co-opt people"
"and entire ships"
"without being detected."
"Do we know where"
"their ship was going?"
"Just outside"
"Federation space."
"There's nothing there."
"There's a reason for everything"
"Control does."
"I'll alert"
"Starfleet as to...Captain?"
"That's a Section 31 ship."
"[alarms sounding]"
"They are all Section 31 ships."
"They're coming for the data."
"For us."
"The signal brought us here"
"for a reason."
"We have the time crystal.SARU:"
Captain.
"30 ships."
"Nearly their entire fleet."
"PIKE: We'll jump until we can figure"
"out how to power the crystal."
BURNHAM:
"They'll keep following us."
"Sir, it took a supernova"
"to power that crystal."
"We don't have"
"the tools we need."
"And we don't have the time"
"to figure out alternatives."
"And we can't wait"
"for another signal to show up."
"What do you propose?"
"We're outgunned."
"We can't delete the data."
"That leaves us"
"only one option."
"We destroy the ship."
