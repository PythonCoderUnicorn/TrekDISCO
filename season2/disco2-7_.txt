"Personal log,"
"Commander Michael Burnham."
"My mother taught me"
"the greatest mysteries"
"come in threes."
"Birth, life, death."
"The past,"
"the present and future."
"That's where the Red Angel"
isfrom.
"We now have confirmation,"
"thanks to Mr. Saru."
"The angel is humanoid"
"and wearing an exosuit"
"made of future technology"
"we've never seen."
"But whose future?"
"And why?"
"The only person who may be able to answer these questions"
"is the one person"
"nobody can find."
"two months before they appeared."
"Which presumes the angel"
"shared them with him"
"for a damn good reason."
"According to his cognitive"
"tests, he had a mental break."
"So, either the"
"angel broke him"
"or chose him because"
"he was broken."
"Well, I don't like"
"either option."
"Maybe, uh, it showed him a"
"future he couldn't process."
"We know that he ran"
"from the psychiatric unit"
"on Starbase 5."
"And we know the shuttle"
"that he stole"
"disappeared somewhere"
"in the Mutara sector."
"Any leads?"
None.
"But if the Federation"
"and Section 31"
"are still looking"
"for him..."
"I think we need"
"to find him first, sir."
"I need permission"
"to go to Vulcan."
"I haven't spoken to my mother"
"or father in some time."
"Sarek's on the"
"Federation task force."
"If he had any"
"information, wed know."
"If he did, yes, we would."
"My mother, on the other hand,"
"she hasn't always seen"
"eye-to-eye with him"
"when it comes to Spock."
"You've already packed"
"your bag, haven't you?"
"Id never do that without"
"your permission, sir."
"Take your leave, Commander."
"Good luck, and hurry back to us."
"Thank you, sir."
"Where are you headed?"
"Were sticking around Kaminar"
"for a while longer."
"The signal that appeared"
"with the Angel"
"left behind traces"
"of residual decay"
"that Starfleet's tasked us"
"with analyzing."
"Hopefully, it'll tell us"
"when and where"
"in the future it came from."
"Then, good luck"
"to you, too, Captain."
PIKE:
"Status report, Mr. Saru."
"The sensors have detected"
"the same spike"
"of tachyon particles"
"Admiral Cornwell's team recorded"
"after our expedition"
"to the asteroid."
"Sir? Sir, these readings"
"cant be accurate."
"5,000 parts"
"per cubic micron?"
"That's a lot."
"Ah, outside"
"a supernova,"
"no ones ever recorded"
"densities at this level."
"Its freaking amazing."
"Excuse me?"
"I'm sorry, sir."
"You know how I get"
"around violations of causality."
"Plus, you said that I shouldn't"
"curse when I was on duty."
"What kind of power"
"source could generate"
"that amount of"
"tachyon particles?"
"Well, the technology may not"
"have been invented yet."
"Lets determine more about"
"this possible power source"
"beyond freaking amazing."
"I am attempting to launch"
"a probe into the anomaly"
"that may help us determine where"
"in the future it came from."
"But the extreme"
"tachyon interference"
"is disrupting"
"our targeting systems."
"Well, lets get closer,"
"then, shall we?"
Helm,
"forward, one-quarter impulse."
"Airiam, assist Mr. Saru"
"with analysis, please."
"Wheres Burnham?"
"On personal leave."
"Why wasn't I informed?"
"Because personal"
"means personal."
"Captain, if Burnham's absence"
"is related"
"to Spock's disappearance,"
"you owe me an explanation."
"I owe you?"
"Owe me."
"Uh, Mr. Tyler,"
"the chair outranks the badge."
"The comms are off-line, sir."
"Tactical systems"
"have failed, too."
"Talk to me, Owo."
OWOSEKUN:
Captain,
"these readings don't"
"make any sense."
"The computers seem caught"
"in some kind of loop."
SARU:
"Computers do not do well"
"with temporal distortions,"
"if that is what"
"we are dealing with."
"Oh, what the frick?"
"TYLER (echoing):"
"You owe me an explanation."
(echoing):
"I owe you?"
"The chair outranks the badge."
"Captain, dead ahead."
"What am I looking at?"
SARU:
"It appears to be"
"a rift in"
"space-time, Captain."
"Full reverse."
S-Sorry.
"Systems back online."
"Okay, lets not do that again."
"Mr. Saru,"
"load your probe onto"
"a shuttle, Ill pilot it"
"close enough to target the"
"anomaly and launch from there."
"SARU: Sir?"
"Test pilot"
"was my first assignment"
"in Starfleet."
"I know"
Discovery's
shuttles
better
"than anyone else on board."
"Well, I have no doubt, sir,"
"but you are vital personnel."
"I'm also the most qualified."
"Are you familiar with the term"
"bad penny, Mr. Tyler?"
"Captain, you can keep me"
"in the dark about Burnham,"
"but not when it comes to"
"intelligence about these signals"
"or the Red Angel. I'm your"
"official liaison to Section 31."
"You have to deal with me."
"And what about"
"the Klingon inside you?"
"You are aware"
"the war is over, right?"
"My problem isn't"
"with Klingons."
"You k*lled"
"a member of this crew."
"At least"
"your shadow did-- Voq."
"Sorry, but there's no way"
"to get rid of him, sir."
"I know the feeling."

SAREK:
"You lied to me, Amanda."
"I assume you hid our son"
"in this sacred crypt"
"because it contains"
"katra stones,"
"which blocks any outside"

"to Spock"
"when he was a little boy, before"
"Michael came into the house?"
"...which way I ought
to go from here?

That depends a good deal"
"on where you want to get to,
said the Cat.

Do you know why

I read him that book?

Because Spock had
difficulties.

Human difficulties.

Learning, reading,

writing.

The Vulcans called it
Ltak Terai.

A temporary complication
remedied at the Learning Center.

No.

He had no support.

Nobody wanted to help
a half-Vulcan child

with a learning disability
he'd inherited from his mother.

And in order to
save our son,

I began to read him a story
about how to survive

when up is down
and left is right.

SAREK:
Your obsession with a book

about chaos has done a
disservice to our children.

They were the ones

who were on both sides
of the looking glass.

Not you, Sarek.

You never truly
respected humanity.

If that were true, I would
have married a Vulcan.

Would you have left Vulcan
for me?

No, you wouldn't.
I sacrificed everything

for our family.

That does not change
the fact that you have

harbored a fugitive,

which is a flagrant
abuse of my authority.

I don't live
under your authority.

I'm your wife

and I'm your partner.

Try again, husband.

SPOCK:
But I don't want to"
"go among mad people,"
"remarked Alice.

Oh, you cant help that,"
"said the Cat."
"Were all mad.
(mouthing)

I'm mad. You're mad."
"But how do you know I'm mad?
said Alice.

You must be, said the Cat."
"He is regressing."
"If Spock relinquishes all logic,"
"hes lost."
BURNHAM:
Father.
"I believe this is connected"
"to the Red Angel."
"Spock saw it."
"And the seven signals,"
"before they appeared to us."
"You hid this from me."
"I wanted to find him first."
"I was trying to save his life."
"Amanda, you"
"are correct."
"Spock needs help,"
"which is why"
you
"must deliver"
"him to Captain Leland."
"Throwing him at the mercy"
"of Section 31"
"might be throwing him"
"to the wolves."
"You want to deliver our son to"

"after Spock is because his mind"
"contains answers the Federation"
"desperately needs."
"Outside of this room,"

"Yeah. But why?"

(screaming)
Tyler!
"(Tyler shouting in Klingon)"
No!
"Hold still."
(grunting)
"Where are we going?"
"To the transporter room."
"I need to be on that shuttle."
"I can fly them out. Move!"
"Sorry, but calculating"
"transporter coordinates"
"from here onto a moving shuttle"
"inside of a temporal distortion?"
"It doesn't look distorted to"
"me, Tilly. Its just anomalous."
"But if your"
"calculations are off"
"by even a fraction,"
"you will end up..."
"Very dead,"
"which is why you'll be running"

"Oh, man, I knew"
"you were gonna say that."
"(door whooshes open)"
"No, w-w-wait, can-can"
"we just stop for a second"
"and think about this?"
"What if we send"
"the PADD over first"
"and see if it..."
"We don't have time."
"In one minute,"
"the shuttle will leave"
"the triangulation zone"
"and well never"
"be able to find it again."
"Right, but, no..."
"There must be another..."
Tilly.
"Trust the math."
"More importantly,"
"trust yourself."
"I wouldn't let just anyone"
"beam me in and out of time."
Okay.
"(metallic trilling)"
Captain.
"Excuse me."
Stamets?
"I'm actually here"
"ten minutes from now."
"Admittedly confusing, but"
"don't worry, I'm gonna"
"get us out of here"
"by using the network"
"as a road map."
"Mm. Oh."
"Did it work?"
"Is Commander Stamets all right?"
"I've got the shuttle."
"Its exiting the anomaly."
"On screen."
"What... is that?"
STAMETS:
Discovery,
"this is Stamets."
"We've picked up a hitchhiker;"

modifications.
"And in addition"
"to it trying to k*ll us,"
"its accessing our"
"ships data core."
"Yellow alert."
"We have your,"
"uh, shuttle screens"
"mirrored here, sir-- whoa."
"The probe is searching"
"our computers"
"at incredible speeds;"
"I will attempt to lock it out."
PIKE:
"Well try on our end."
"Grab the Fahrenheit tools."
"Rhys, can you target"
"the probe"
"without destroying"
"the shuttle?"
"Not with your shields so low."
"Can we beam them out?"
"They're too near the rift to get"
"a lock, sir."
"Hold on, Ill move us"
"closer to"
Discovery.
"(power faltering)"
"Plasma's gone. Were in drift."
"Its pulling us"
"back into the rift."
(grunts)
"I've disabled"
"the cameras"
"for 60 seconds,"
"so listen closely."
"Your instincts are"
"correct, Michael."
"That machine is a"
"memory extractor."
"It will destroy"
"your brothers mind."
"Why should I believe you?"
"Leland is just a puppet"
"following orders."
"And I didn't"
"think you'd want"
"your brothers"
"blood on your hands."
"So you're telling me this out"
"of the goodness of your heart?"
"No, the goodness of yours."
"I know so much more about"
"you than you can imagine."
"But that's for"
"another time."
"Right now,"
"you're going to attack me,"
"then rescue Spock,"
"which is good for you."
"And that will make"
"Leland look bad,"
"which is good for me."
"Ten seconds, Michael."
"So, what will it...?"
(grunts)
(coughs)
"Trying to make it look good."
(coughs)
"Not bad."
"Once more, with feeling."
