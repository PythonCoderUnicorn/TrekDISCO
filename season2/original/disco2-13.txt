TILLY:
Who the hell are you?

What's your name?

Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po.

I ran away
because I wasn't ready.

Supposed to become...
The queen. Okay.

Let's get you home.

L'RELL: Boreth is not
for the faint of heart.

No Klingon,
let alone a human,

has ever taken a time crystal
from the monastery

without great sacrifice.

TENAVIK: A warning,
Captain, the present

is a veil between
anticipation and horror.

You may still choose to walk
away from this future.

(screams)

But if you take the crystal,
your fate

will be sealed forever.

BURNHAM: Every Section 31
ship is required to check in

on an hourly basis,
but this ship checked in

ten minutes past its hour.

You're not Gant. Gant expired
with the rest of the crew.

You are the most
effective tool

to acquire the Sphere archive
from the Discovery.

BURNHAM: Control isn't just
contained to Leland anymore.

It has the ability
to co-opt people

and entire ships
without being detected.

- I'll alert Starfleet as to...
- Captain?

That's a Section 31 ship.

SPOCK: They are all
Section 31 ships.

We're outgunned.

We can't delete the data.

That leaves us only one option.

We destroy the ship.

PIKE: Owosekun, send
a ship-wide alert:

we are evacuating Discovery.

(indistinct chatter)

BURNHAM:
Personal log, stardate 1051.8.

Thank you.
You got it.

BURNHAM: We're in the process
of abandoning our ship

in order to destroy it.

This is actually happening,
yet somehow

I still can't believe it.

Long-range sensors show
Control is on the move

and gaining quickly.

It's infiltrated
our subspace radio relays,

so we can't reach Starfleet
for backup.

Ship-to-ship communication
is all we've got.

Discovery to Enterprise,
we're at 20, 15,

ten, nine,

...seven, six, five...

Engaging reverse thrusters.

Three... two...

Evacuation corridors deployin.

Bridge is five by,
and hold for airlock breach.

BURNHAM: Discovery contains
the one thing in all the galaxy

that Control needs, the data
to become fully conscious.

My mother sacrificed everything
to stop Control

from getting that data,

and now she's counting on us
to finish the job.

But is this really
the only solution?

I look in the mirror

and can hardly recognize
myself anymore.

All of these questions
without answers.

There are seven signals,
but we've only seen four.

We have a time crystal
that we don't know how to use.

Captain Pike has always had
faith that they play a part

in some grand design.

Now... more than ever...

I wish I had his certainty.

Burnham, let's move.
The ship's almost clear.

It's time to get the crystal
over to Enterprise.

The signal led us to Boreth
for this. Why?

My mother's gone,
the suit's destroyed,

Now Discovery.

It can't just be
about endings, can it?

We can figure it out, Commander,
but only if we're walking.

I cannot let everything
my mother sacrificed for

be for nothing.

Sometimes

we know the role we're meant
to play, sometimes we don't.

I'm not sure which is better,
to be honest.

And we don't know if we'll have
the strength, do we?

Until the moment comes.

SARU: Final crew are
departing, Captain.

We should proceed.
Understood, Mr. Saru.

- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

RHYS: Shields unable
to absorb full impact!

LELAND:
Goodbye.

COMPUTER:
Remote auto-destruct enabled.

(powering down)

Life support, environmental

will deactivate
in five minutes.

All Discovery crew is accounted
for on the Enterprise, Captain.

Field generators disengaged?
Affirmative.

Shields are also off-line,
and the warp core

has been prepared
for overload.

Have we forgotten anything?

There will be
no half measures, sir.

She will go with the dignity
she deserves.

Commander.

(indistinct chatter)

PIKE:
Deck one.

You brought
Siranna's knife.

My sister would not
be pleased to hear

that I had left it behind.

And it gives me hope
that we will endure.

MAN:
Captain on the bridge.

She's all yours, Chris.

She looks as good as I remember.

Welcome home, Captain.

Good to be back.

Wish it were
under better circumstances.

Don't we all.

All major systems
are back online,

and we'll have no more
holographic communications...

ever.

Probably for the best.

Lieutenant Amin,
status update.

Sensors show
Leland and his armada

are picking up speed, Captain.

Captain Georgiou
has just arrived, sir.

Permission to
come aboard?

PIKE:
Granted. Have her come on up.

Number One, take us
to a safe distance, please.

Aye, Captain.

Captain Georgiou,
welcome to the Enterprise.

Orange? Really? Ugh.

Your report
on Specialist Gant

was rather enlightening.

Nanobots.

Yes. Now is not the time.

Nonsense. It's good
to get a little distance

from something you love.

On the other hand, I look
forward to hunting Leland down

to the ends of the galaxy
so I can watch

every piece of technology
exit his skin bit by bit.

Leland didn't deserve
what he got.

Better him than me. Or you.

NUMBER ONE:
We're at distance, sir.

All right, everyone. Eyes front.

We'll never see
another like her.

Initiate remote auto-destruct.

COMPUTER:
Auto-destruct initiated.

NUMBER ONE: Captain,
D iscovery's shields are up.

What the hell?
Again.

(photon torpedoes fire)

Analysis.

SPOCK: Given recent
events, I believe the Sphere data

may be the cause.
It's protecting itself.

We tried to delete the data;
it wouldn't let us.

If the data has merged with
Discovery, that would explain

its ability to use
Discovery's resources

to ensure its survival.

Are you saying we won't be
able to destroy the ship?

NUMBER ONE (echoing):
Leland's ships are now in range,

Captain.

OWOSEKUN:

Excuse me, Captain.

PIKE:
What do you mean?

The Sphere's data has already
merged with Discovery.

We should have anticipated
it would use our ship

and our shields

to protect itself,
like it's always done.

You sound rather certain.

I am.

How long until
Leland gets here?

An hour. Maybe less.

Options. We know we
can't delete the data.

Nor, it seems,
can we destroy Discovery.

Even if you jump away,
Control will not stop coming.

Eventually Leland,
or some version of him,

would find you.

Ergo, Discovery's very existence
is the problem.

Of course.

As long as Discovery
exists here and now,

this will never be over.

You are proposing

we remove Discovery
from the galactic equation

entirely?

How, exactly, are we
supposed to do that?

The crystal.

This is why we have it.

To take the data out
of this time

so Control can never get it.

Discovery has to go

Season 02 Episode 13
Title: "Such Sweet Sorrow?"
\

(original Star Trek theme
plays)

PIKE: How do we get
Discovery t o the future

before Leland catches up
with us?

CORNWELL: Dr. Burnham's suit
was destroyed on Essof IV.

That was the only method
of time travel we know of.

SARU:
We have the technical designs

from Section 31.

We can attempt to rebuild it.

Do it. To my physical
specifications, please.

STAMETS:
That's not possible, sir.

The suit was tailored
to Dr. Burnham's DNA.

Which makes my MRNA
the closest genetic match.

I'll do it.

My mother started this.
I'm gonna finish it.

Even if we could adapt
the code to your biology,

the exoskeleton is made
from a composite alloy

that we can't synthesize.

Well, the alloy is
tritanium-based.

It might be possible
to melt down

part of a cargo bulkhead
to cast a mold.

Not to sweat the details,

but do you even know how
to fly the thing?

I learned the basics
from her logs.

I'm sure there'll be
some trial and error

opening the wormhole.

If Discovery were
on autopilot,

it could follow you through.

How will you find
your way back?

Everything we know
about the signals

suggests they're indicative
of a design.

I'm willing to trust that.

Are you saying you believe

that another signal
will just reveal itself

because we need it to?

These signals could
only have been set

by an individual
with access to a time suit

and knowledge of our
specific circumstances.

We believed your mother was
the only Red Angel.

However, the bioneural signature
identified another.

You. Her efforts
were focused entirely

on the Sphere data.

She stated that she did not
set the signals.

Therefore, you did.

But if it was me, why?

What am I trying
to lead us to?

That remains to be seen.

But I agree with
Captain Pike.

There is intention
to your design.

I'll have our engineering team
start the fabrication process.

SARU:
And the time crystal.

There is still the matter
of activating it.

My parents used
a stellar-lensing array.

If we can locate
an unstable red giant...

NUMBER ONE:
The odds of finding one

in any given sector
are pretty high.

STAMETS:
But pretty low of finding one

in a supernova state
specifically.

It can take hundreds of years.

So pick a nova and fire
an antimatter missile

into its core.

We would be directly responsible
for destroying

all life within dozens of
light-years, if not more.

Yeah.
Uh...

We're not doing that.

I thought there were
no bad ideas.

That's a lie.
That's a bad one.

NICOLA:
Admiral, Captain Pike,

there's something
you need to see.

And then there were five.

Do we have a lock
on the signal?

Still working on it.

MANN:
Sensors show Captain Leland...

Control... is five minutes out.

Red alert.

Mr. Saru,
we'll return to Discovery

with all essential personnel.

Commander Stamets, you will
jump us to that signal.

- Yes, Captain.
- Copy that.

I'll get Enterprise to the
signal as fast as possible.

I'll join you.

Have any personnel
not directly involved

with fabricating
the time suit start

retrofitting all shuttles
and pods for combat operations.

You should do the same.

It'll be us against
whatever Leland's bringing.

Actually, our odds might be
a little better than that.

I took the liberty
of retrofitting our shuttle

and landing pod complement
with enhanced phasers,

and I commandeered the new
experimental tactical flyers,

assuming the shit
would hit the fan.

Well done, Number One.

Godspeed, Captain.

You, too, Admiral.

We'll rendezvous
at the fifth signal.

♪ ♪

PIKE: And where has
the signal led us now?

Class M planet... Xahea.

Really? Xahea?

Wait, for real?

What do you know, Ensign?

The queen.
The queen?

Yeah, yeah, no, no.
I-I-I know the queen of Xahea.

We share a love of engineering.

And what might
Xahea have to do

with powering the time crystal?

Well, Xahea's remarkable for
its natural dilithium supply.

And its queen,
Her Serene Highness.

Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po...

or-or Po for short,
she, uh, she's only 17,

but she developed a technology
to recrystallize it.

To recrystallize
dilithium?

Well, if true, Starfleet
would no longer

need to seek new sources
of dilithium for its warp cores.

She's brilliant... but she won't
tell anyone how she did it.

She-she doesn't trust anyone
with that information.

So, besides being brilliant,
she's also prudent.

- Mr. Bryce, open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

Let's see if Ensign Tilly
can convince.

Her Serene Highness
to help us figure out

why the signal brought us here.

I think she'll be
intrigued, sir,

and probably happy she doesn't
have to stuff herself

into a cargo pallet.

What?

Hmm? Nothing.

Reset the cube and
don't forget to purge

the secondary EPS relay.

Yes, sir.
Quickly, quickly.

We have shuttles
and pods to retrofit.

(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

Are you all right?

From the jump.

I-I'm fine... thank you.

Listen...
Listen...

You go.

Um... once Commander Burnham

takes this ship to
wherever she's going...

I'm thinking
I might take a break

from starships.

I passed up a job at
the Vulcan Science Academy

a few months ago.

Or maybe I'll just... live
on a station for a while.

I don't know.

Forward motion.

I get it.

I thought a lot about it,
and... you were right.

If I can take anything

from all this,

it's that forward motion...

is the most honest choice...

for both of us.

Thank you for saying that.

I hope that...

whatever life
you find from here,

whoever you find it with...

...that you're happy, Hugh.

You, too, Paul.

Once the Enterprise
catches up with us...

...I'll be joining them.

Of course.

I need to see how the...
fabrication team is doing

with the suit.

Ice cream is the last thing
I was expecting.

Oh, she's all about sugar.
You have no idea.

Your Serene Highness, may I...

Tilly!

(Tilly and Po giggle)

Is that spumoni?

(sniffs)

My calculations for
small-particle dispersion

in hydrogenated carbohydrates
were so on point.

But I just end up with goo.

Fascinating.

Po, this is.

Commander Michael Burnham.

Your roomie.

You look taller
in your photos.

Thank you...

And this is Captain Pike.
This is the captain.

Your Highness,
Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po.

Wow, you're good.

Po's fine.
Thank you.

Can you eat and walk?
I'll fill you in on the way.

Mm-hmm.

So, you have a time crystal,

which I've only
ever read about,

and no method by which
to activate it.

And you have a time suit.

Which genius built that?

My mom.

Hmm. I had a special mom, too.

Ugh.

So you want
to use the suit

to travel through time

with this ship flying
behind you, yes? Yes.

And then you want
to cut the ship loose

and come back alone?

- Hmm.
- GEORGIOU: This endeavor would be

rather ridiculous
if Michael intended

to return with the ship.

One of the fun things
about becoming queen

of the most
politically relevant

planet in the galaxy
is that

I don't have to listen
to any snark.

I made it an actual law.
What?

Oh, uh, we believe
that there's Ugh.

A reason the signal
brought us to your planet.

What's happening?

It's nuclear particle physics.

Pretty sure
she's calculating

the reaction rate
between particles.

E = mc squared stuff.

I like you.

- I like you, too.
- GEORGIOU: Good.

We're friends now.

The goop in this bowl
is vile.

I can modify
my dilithium incubator

to trigger an ongoing
cascade of energy

within the crystal
by combining it

with dark energy.

It'll replicate the power
of a supernova.

And charge your crystal.

I get to make a supernova.

Today rocks.

I will need
energy, though.

Like, Planck-level.

RENO: That's a little
more than the EPS grid

normally allows.

We could pull from
the spore drive.

It would take 12 hours
for the spore drive to recover.

How are we supposed to fight
off dozens of enemy ships

without being able
to jump away?

We'd be... going into battle
without our spore drive.

If that's what it takes
to power the suit,

- we'll have to make it work.
- Good.

There is just one problem.

Certain death in battle
wasn't enough of a problem?

RENO:
This is bigger.

Charging the crystal this way
is like using a waterfall

to get a drink of water.

It'll work, but then you drown.

I don't... follow.

I believe
what they wish to convey

is that continuous regeneration

of energy will
ultimately overwhelm

the structural integrity
of the crystal.

Causing it to burn out.

BURNHAM:
Meaning, I can take Discovery

to the future.

But I won't be able
to come back.

(overlapping comm chatter)

It's a one-way trip.

You're leaving? Forever?

SPOCK:
That is correct.

To ensure the
Sphere data remains

out of Leland's reach,

Michael must remain
in the future.

Permanently.

What does that even mean?

Where in the future?

Assuming I don't get lost
in the wormhole,

in theory,

my mother should have returned

to her anchor point
on Terralysium.

So hopefully I will
land there, too.

And there's no
technology there,

so Discovery will be safe.
TYLER: "In theory"?

"Hopefully"? Michael, you could
land anywhere in any time.

We are aware.

BURNHAM: Apparently, this
is what I'm meant to do.

Trust the mystery.

Are you sure there's
no other way?

If there were, we
would have found it.

Commander Burnham will use
the suit to open a wormhole.

Discovery will be n
autopilot behind her.

Our job is to clear a path.

Anything in
the vicinity will be

either destroyed
or pulled into the future

with her,
and we cannot risk that.

This is crazy.
We have a spore drive.

Sorry, lovebug,
we don't.

STAMETS: We need the power
to charge the crystal.

It won't be
up and running again

until long after
Michael's gone.

Captain, the Enterprise
will arrive in 57 minutes.

Control is only ten minutes
behind them.

PIKE:
All right.

This is what you've trained for.

Eyes up for Commander Burnham.

I wish there was
more time.

There isn't.

I love you.

All of you.

Thank you for the greatest
moments of my life.

Thank you all.

Let's get that crystal charged
and get to work.

(overlapping chatter)




( =  || []).({});

You're afraid.

(laughs nervously)

It'll be fine.

Better than fine,
whatever happens.

- You give me too much credit.
- No.

You taught me to walk tall and
straight into the heart of it.

Just like you'll teach
your crew one day

when you have your own
ship to command.

Thank you for helping us.

You're helping us pretty much
save the entire galaxy.

You didn't have to do that.
You could have just...

Stayed out of it?

No.

My people, my planet,
they're at risk, too.

Oh, can I just say that
I love the way you say that?

"My planet."
"My people."

Look how far you've come.
It's beautiful, Po.

Even this thing is bizarre

There'll be enough dark energy

I'm gonna miss you,
young lady.

What do you mean?
I'm not going anywhere.

What?

No. No, you can't stay
on board, you're the queen.

Exactly. My planet
is my sister.

If I die, I die
protecting her.

That's the only queen
I know how to be.

Besides,
what am I supposed to do...

wave a hanky from my throne?

We're a team, all of us.

You're stuck with me.

- This is stupid.
- What?

with a martyr complex.

It doesn't have
to be like this.

It does have to be like this

for a million reasons
you will never understand.

I understand perfectly.

You're very invested
in being selfless, Michael.

And I'm not the only one willing
to exploit that, you know.

You can add this up
however you want.

I'm getting in that suit and
I'm doing what I need to do.

And if we're both still alive
when this is all over,

then you can talk to me about
my gaping character flaws.

BURNHAM:
How did you know?

SAREK:
Our katras.

We had tried to reach you
through Starfleet.

Control took down
our subspace relays.

We only have ship-to-ship.

You're truly leaving us,
Michael.

We can't allow the data to stay.

It's the only way.

Michael, you do not
have to do this.

Mother, yes, I do.

I had lost everything.

I was broken...

and I was alone.

(voice breaking): You both...
put me back together.

Piece by piece.

Even though
you had a son,

you took me in
as your daughter.

And as much as I tried
to  you away,

you never let me go.

And I love you for
never letting me go.

And I need you both to know

that what you gave me,

I will carry it everywhere I go.

And I will never let you down.

Michael, we are
so proud of you...

and your courage

and what you are about
to do for everyone.

SAREK: It is the secret
wish of every parent that

our children make right
the mistakes

we ourselves have made.

I know I have not always been

the ideal father.

Or husband, Amanda.

I am...
Impossible.

(laughs)

Uh,
I will accept improbable.

Well, that's big of you, Father.

For my failures
I humbly ask both of you

for forgiveness.

Of course.

Promise me that
you'll take care of Spock.

I will always be here
for our son, always.

Even as I keep
my distance,

as he has asked.

He loves you very deeply.

So do I.

Michael.

We love you.

Time travel is not
for the faint of heart.

Every jump,
I say a silent thank you

to whatever brilliant being

invented polyphobic
metamaterial.

Without her or him,
I'd be dead from radiation,

temperature fluctuations,
or painful blood clots.

Humans were not meant for this.

And that's the easy part.

Navigation, on the other hand...

Now I really hope whoever
you are, watching this someday,

you're not crazy enough
to try a jump,

but if you're as half
as stubborn as I am,

let me tell you how
to do it the right way.

You announced that
you're leaving forever,

and I wasn't even there to sob
and wail and throw myself

- at your feet.
- You were a little busy.

And our goodbye needed to be...

Nonexistent.

It's not who we are, Michael.

It's not who any of us are.

Some people are

Uh, Po is designing siege
weapons, which I can't even...

Anyway, we're here

because we're

No.

No, I can't let you do this.

We're not asking permission.

This is impossible.
You have lives.

You have people who love you.

Families who love you.
You'll never see them again.

Commander, our families accepted
the possibility of this moment

when we joined Starfleet.

Committing to a life

amongst the stars
is, in itself,

a resolution to leave
some things behind.

But I don't know
what the future holds.

STAMETS:
Nobody does.

We just have now.

We are coming with you, Michael.

Further argument
would be futile.

Please accept this.

(stammers) SARU: I am sure

what you are about to say
will be beautiful,

but it is done, Michael,

Lieutenants Detmer and Owosekun,

I wouldn't be here if you hadn't
saved my life on the way

to that asteroid.

Lieutenant Nilsson,
you've stepped up for Airiam

in a way that honors her.

Lieutenants Bryce and Rhys,
you're calm under pressure.

And Commander Saru,

I'm gonna miss
the hell out of you.

Lieutenant Spock...

...there aren't words.

Commander Nhan has
requested permission

to stay aboard Discovery.

If I can be of help, that is.

Well... it would be our privilege
to have you, Commander.

As for you...

...most people will
never get a chance

to learn what's
in their own hearts.

If we figure it out, it's
often not what we expected,

or even what we would have
chosen for ourselves.

I am very grateful, Commander,

to have been here to watch you
discover your heart.

Thank you.

I know that you...
I know that all of you

will face your destinies
with bravery and honor.

Even those moments to come

that will test the
strongest among us.

Thank you... sir.

Mr. Saru,

you have the conn
as Commander Burnham leads you

through the wormhole.

As to what happens after that...

I would prefer if we focus
on our respective tasks for now

and discuss the captaincy later.

There are many things
to consider.

NUMBER ONE: Enterprise to Discovery.

Control's fleet will be arriving

in four minutes, 58 seconds,
Captain.

Thank you, Number One.
Mr. Bryce,

make sure anyone else who wants to
leave is on their way.

- Aye, Captain.
- The rest of you...

...back to work.

Captain Pike.

STAMETS: At this rate, the
crystal won't be charged

before Leland arrives.

And you do know

that the suit is utterly useless
without the crystal, don't you?

Preacher, choir. Why do
you think I asked for help?

Sir, sorry, I,

I get a little snarky
when I'm stressed.

The problem is the cage. It's
interfering with the charge.

Yeah, but without the cage...

Everyone will see visions
of the future

and their heads will explode,
I know.

Okay, ideas. Go.

Well, we could move the charging
unit inside the cage.

And potentially redistribute
the charge

to the point of instability?

No. Next?

Well, what if we, uh, increase

the diameter
of the cage openings?

That way, the wavelength

of the charging frequency
can move through faster.

And that may let the effects
of the crystal seep out,

which is why the cage is there.

BRYCE: Attention: final
shuttles are departing.

Transporter power diverting

to defense systems
in three minutes.

Okay, out, both of you.

Make sure nobody else comes in.

Wait. You're not gonna...

Got a better idea?

The mission's the mission,
whatever I see.

Look, buck up, guys.

I'll be fine.

Thank you, Jett.

I still dislike you.

Feeling's mutual.

OWOSEKUN: An undetonated
photon torpedo is lodged

in Enterprise's hull!

Mr. Bryce, open a ship-wide
channel, please.

Aye, sir.

Channel open.

This is Commander Saru.

All crew to stations
immediately.

Red alert.
(alarm sounding)

Captain, we are standing by.

Leaving now, Mr. Saru.

I haven't been sure
what to make of you lately,

but I'm glad to have had you
on our side for this.

More fun to come,
assuming we survive.

Good luck.

Glad to have you
on our side, too, Mr. Tyler.

As am I.

Does that mean you trust me?

Why do you ask?

Because there's something
I need to do.

And it means leaving
before any of this starts.

Initializing.

I'm Terran, by the way.

From your mirror universe.

What mirror universe?

DETMER:
Attention, all vessels.

Leland's fleet has arrived.

WOMAN:
Captain on the bridge.

Nine more enemy vessels just
dropped out of warp, Captain.

We are surrounded.

All enemy vessels
armed and ready.

Shields up.

Prepare for battle.
